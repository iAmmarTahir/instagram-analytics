- no naps on day 1. No matter how tired you are. 
- get exercise. If possible, outside. 
- as much time outside as possible. Watching the sun rise and set does wonders for your internal clock. 
BTW : these 3 kids really deserve a lot of credit for just being such super troopers and keeping good attitudes even when they’re exhausted.

2046124355,thebucketlistfamily,C3agXIWuKBV,True,"😞 This is difficult for me to write. Last week I stepped outside my comfort zone and shared a very personal goal of mine to have my book make the New York Times Best Seller list. 😱 The list isn’t released until this Sunday but my editor at NatGeo said publishers find out a few days early and she would call me right away. I got the call. She shared the sad news that I didn’t make the list. 😔 I kept it together on the call..but the tears came hard as soon as we said bye. I’m surprised I care so much about this. I cried for about 5 minutes and after a great pep talk from a supportive husband was able to pick myself up. 🥹

💛 I want to make it clear that above all, I’m extremely proud of my book and don’t want this to cast any sort of shadow over the past 4 years that were nothing but a positive experience of writing and creating this treasure for families all around the world. 🌎 The quality of my hard work is definitely more important than the accolade of New York Times Best Seller. But I think, if I were to try my best to explain why I’m feeling so sad and even slightly embarrassed it’s because 2 things: I’ve never wanted anything like this for myself. I’m sure so many other mothers out there can relate. I endlessly cheer and support my family, but rarely do I want something so purely for myself. This was that for me. ❤️

Secondly, the Bucket List community has rallied so hard behind me. I have have felt it every day of this journey. I was excited to celebrate this achievement all of us together. ❤️💙💚 You’ve done so much for me. Thx to you, we’ve surpassed NatGeo’s presale records. I’m going to keep my head up and focus on the positive. There’s still chance I may make the list in future weeks so I’ll keep trying my best. Positive reviews of my book on Amazon and Goodreads help so much. ⭐️ I want you to know that I screenshot your thoughtful reviews and every time you share my book on Instagram in such cute creative ways and add it to a journal I’ve been keeping of this book publishing journey. Thank you for being a part of my story and all the ups and downs. This day is a down for me.
