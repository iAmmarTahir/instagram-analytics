5829468714,sydneyisopen,C3JIo-asyhQ,False,"Join us in an exclusive behind the scenes tour and discover the stories behind the extraordinary heritage-listed landmark and Sydney’s longest-serving power station at White Bay. 

The tour will include never-before-seen areas of White Bay Power Station, including the vast and cathedral-like Boiler House and Turbine Hall, as well as some hidden spaces not open to the general public. In addition, you will be able to see remarkably intact equipment and machinery and learn about the last remaining example of a coal-fired harbourside industrial complex in NSW.

Developed by Museums of History NSW as part of the Sydney Open Series in partnership with Placemaking NSW and the Biennale of Sydney, White Bay will once again energise Sydney as part of the 2024 Biennale of Sydney. 

Places are extremely limited for this exclusive free offer, see our link in bio to book now.

A series of internal arches reference how the building was once three buildings, now combined. Other reminders of an earlier era include a narrow horse cartway to the back courtyard now occupied by three popular small bars that enliven Sydney’s hidden ‘creative precinct’.
 
Gray Puksand invites the community, especially families and children, to experience virtual reality in architecture and the opportunity to create their own ‘mood boards’ with informal instruction by Gray Puksand designers at Sydney Open.
