2631722,tenleymolzahn,C3q9z_qRgK7,True,"The other day was my day for the “dreaded Glucose test” that typically happens between week 24-28 of pregnancy. I went an alternative route during my pregnancy with Rell so I never experienced the glucola drink, BUT this time my doctor offered a natural alternative to the standard glucose drink, called the Fresh Test. (I have no affiliation with this) It ended up not being so “dreaded” of an experience after all.
It still creates that glucose load with 50g of sugar, but it tastes like a refreshing lemonade and it’s non-gmo, with no additives and preservatives, and I didn’t feel icky at all. (It does warn that some may experience side effects— that is a lot of sugar at once!) I was even able to eat a boiled egg before my test as mine was a non-fasting test, but of course follow what your provider suggests! I mixed the powder with some water and drank it an hour before my blood draw. The visit to the lab was easy. And now I just wait for my results! 🙏🙏

I wanted to share this quick experience and just bring awareness that there is a natural alternative that you can explore with your doctor when it’s time for your Glucose Test during pregnancy. Obviously this is an important step for mama and baby during pregnancy, so this is up to you and your doctor, but I personally love learning about other alternatives that feel right to me.",110,1482,1708651242,"{'id': '212907650', 'has_public_page': True, 'name': 'Carlsbad, California', 'slug': 'carlsbad-california'}",https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/429568362_797779685701537_4659470639183493233_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=n7cUXTAGPzkAX8pvTnp&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfA0QZJftwv0oLgKUpzd0wev5n-v8XziAena6b3DhmZpuw&oe=65E5AC3C&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
2631722,tenleymolzahn,C3oeu-9xbcm,True,"SAVE this for a quick Egg Free Breakfast option!
Rell has never liked eggs- never. Which led us to exploring if there was something instinctual behind it and we learned she had an egg allergy when she was a baby. The great news is, she can eat eggs baked into things, and I think she’s growing out of this allergy BUT she still dislikes eggs. Obviously eggs are an easy and awesome way for quick protein for breakfast— especially in the form of egg bites! SO it was time to explore a new Quick Protein option for breakfast and she LOVES these Sausage bites! We call them “muffins” 😉 Wether you’re catering to an egg allergy in your home or not- this is a great breakfast alternative to keep in your fridge or freezer for when you need a quick and healthy breakfast grab!
*I make these gluten free- and they can easily be made dairy free!

RECIPE
-1lb ground Breakfast Sausage
-1-2 cups finely chopped broccoli florets (optional, but a great way to add greens into breakfast!)
-1 cup your choice of gluten free flour (I used Bob’s Red Mill Paleo All Purpose mix)
-1 tsp baking powder
-1 cup shredded cheese- I use goat cheddar. You can simply make this dairy free with a dairy free cheese alternative!
-3/4 cup Almond Milk (or your choice of milk)
—
•Sauté 1 lb breakfast sausage & finely chopped broccoli florets in avocado oil until sausage is fully cooked 
•In a mixing bowl, add 1 cup gluten free flour, 
1 tsp baking powder, & mix together. 
•Then add 1 cup shredded cheese. Mix all together.
•Add and mix in cooked sausage & broccoli to the dry mix. 
•Add 3/4 cup of Almond Milk. Mix together well.
•Scoop mixture into pre-greased cupcake pan- I use avocado oil spray. 
•Bake for 20-25 minutes at 400 degrees.

Enjoy these!! You can store in the fridge for a few days, or freeze them for when needed! Approved by my toddler— and my husband and I love them too!
