""There was at best a vague plan. It was a true dirtbag trip""
The trip seemed simple enough when Neeld Messler proposed it. Drive north with a car packed full of caving equipment and push the deepest pit in Canada past its 836-foot depth.
The trip was epic, my first true expedition. Equal amounts exhilarating and terrifying.

8047909,salvarezphoto,C2pOJDNszbW,False,"I've always had a fascination with the underground world. At first, I was obsessed with being one of the few people who could go into a cave. As my career progressed what caves preserve began to be more important. The underground world can act as a time capsule holding artwork made by people long before us. Those ancient artists are sending us messages from the past. My friend @dustign calls them ""love notes in a bottle"" from our ancestors. 
Those artists in the past are speaking to us if we let them. They are not just telling us who they were, they are telling us who we all are.

If one image could sum up all of humanity it would be the hand print. I have photographed them on every continent and across the time span of human history. This one is 36,000 years old from El Castillo in Spain. What the person who made this one meant by placing their hand on a cave wall and blowing pigment around it is lost to time, but how can you look at this image and not feel a connection to them?
