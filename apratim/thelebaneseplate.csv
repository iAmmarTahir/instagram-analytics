Born & brought up in the suburbs of Sydney to Lebanese immigrant parents Lina started off her career as a Secondary School Teacher and worked her way up to school Principal of an independent school.
After giving up this career in education, her passion for food as a way to¬†hang on to a special part of her Lebanese heritage flourished. Growing up the daughter of immigrants, emersed in a world of clashing cultures, food became the most ideal way to link both worlds and form an Australian ‚Äì Lebanese identity she was proud of.
Over the last few years, Lina has created content for some of Australia‚Äôs largest brands and companies from Kenwood to ABC Everyday to Woolworths and Ebay Australia. She was chosen as a contributor to¬†‚ÄòNew Voices on Food‚Äô¬†(an anthology of works celebrating the diversity of voices to be found within the Australian food landscape). She has also appeared on Australian TV for cooking segments on¬†Studio 10, a few episodes of SBS Food‚Äôs¬†The Cook Up¬†and appears for regular segments on ABC‚Äôs Weekend Breakfast News to chat all things food.

Again you have deliciously tender zucchini, that are also carefully hollowed out and filled with a mixture of rice, minced meat, tomatoes and spices. Unlike my last stuffed zucchini recipe, however, this one is gently simmered to perfection in a flavourful tomato sauce. In this video I also stuffed a few mini capsicums, which is delicious too üëåüèº

12 grey / Lebanese zucchini 
300g lamb loin chops or neck 
Olive oil 
1 bulb garlic
125g cherry tomatoes, halved 
1 onion, sliced into thin rings 
4 cups water or veg stock 
1 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp sugar 
1 tsp salt 

To prepare stuffing, add all ingredients in a bowl & mix until well combined. 

In a large jug add stock or water, tomato paste, 1 tsp sugar & 1 tsp salt. Mix & set aside. 

Cut the top off the zucchini and carefully shave off the dried tips at the end without removing flesh. Hollow out the zucchini carefully removing the flesh. You want to create a cavity for stuffing without bursting or breaking zucchini.

Wash zucchini & set aside to dry.

1 tbsp oil
1 small onion, diced
500g beef mince
1 1/2 tsp baharat 
1 tsp pomegranate molasses 
1 tbsp pine nuts

Heat olive oil in a fry pan. Add pine nuts and toast until they just turn a golden brown. Add the onion & saut√© until soft. Add the mince, stir to brown and remove large lumps of meat. Add baharat, molasses & salt/pepper to taste. Stir through. Return pine nuts to pan. Combine well. Set aside to cool.

Once stuffing has cooled, use fingers to gently stuff each zucchini. 

In a large fry pan, melt 2 tbsp ghee. Fry the zucchini, turning frequently, in batches until they just change colour. Return all the zucchini to pan & cover with just enough water. Bring to a gentle boil & leave to simmer for 20 min. (Place a heat proof plate on the zucchini to keep them submerged). 

At 20 min the zucchini should have softened. Remove from water & set aside. Do not discard the cooking water. Strain it & set aside. (There should be about 2 cups of liquid, if less top it up with more water to make 2 cups).

On the stovetop, pour your goat‚Äôs yoghurt into a large pot and add the reserved zucchini cooking water and salt. Add your washed rice and stir frequently for 10 minutes on low heat. Add the cornflour dissolved in water. Stir for a minute or two. The yoghurt will begin to thicken.
