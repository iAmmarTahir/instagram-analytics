181427489,ryanlongnecker,C3QcZUEP939,True,"On this day in 2020 I was waking up to snow shoe in Andermatt, Switzerland. Just one of the many adventures as one of two representatives from the United States for their 2-week Global Influencer Summit. I would return home to go speak for my first time at WPPI  just weeks before the world would shut down.

My efforts shifted to caring more for my family, and taking a job that I truly and happily thought would be the rest of my life, but it did not turn out that way. And for the last 4 years I was happy to set down what I knew to focus on what was in front of me even if the breath in my creative lungs was very shallow.

Over the last 4 months I‚Äôve been sorting out next steps. I was recently challenged to put together a reel of my work to share. For all the ways my short memory and impuslivity have served me in moments of needed courage, it hasn‚Äôt always helped me stay organized... so, it took some time. Going back through the work over the last 16 years reminded me how fortunate I have been to do something I loved for so long that has allowed me to see so much of this beautiful planet. For years, whether it was a brand or a fellow creative, I was able to be in very personal conversations with people that wanted to communicate something uniquely their own to the world. The drive to create beautiful things is a bass note in the soul of so many people, and being in that space was much more rewarding than it was work. I‚Äôm hoping photography, creative direction, and making beautiful things is not just a part of my past, but even if it were, it‚Äôs been very formational in who I am now.

I hope you‚Äôll watch, and if it at all makes sense to share it with someone who might want to see it please do. You can find the full resolution version on my bio link

181427489,ryanlongnecker,C2pv0ngJUoS,True,"I saw @karlieplace post a bit of this editing style on a reel yesterday and I just thought it was amazing. Shout out to hers, you should definitely go check it out. 

When I see the dodge/burn notes on old film prints it‚Äôs a reminder that the art and intention of the shot doesn‚Äôt end until it‚Äôs delivered. I imagine some people would rather enjoy the magic without seeing how the sausage is made but I LOVE editing and always have.

I came up in this industry at a time where there was this odd mystique and elitism that I thankfully avoided, but I saw it discourage SO many people. And there was a tension because my income was also tied to education regarding editing and presets, and carving out a brand that was uniquely my voice. I‚Äôd much rather contribute to the shared pool of liberating knowledge so that the beautiful thing you were meant to do is not trapped behind something as dull as tone curves and split toning. 

The anchors of journalistic integrity are different than those for eliciting emotion. But you are also free to, and encouraged to, be unashamed about what does and doesn‚Äôt land with your creative preference. Just don‚Äôt make that the primary thing about your engagements with people on the internet.
