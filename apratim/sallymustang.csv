The sun has been shining nearly all Month. I lay like a cat curled in the warm embrace. I notice how different everything is when the sun is out. How sparkly the rivers are. Three black cockatoos soar every afternoon over the forest canopy. 
I Planted a tiny peach tree in the garden 3 years ago and harvested 30 or so juicy sweet peaches üçë this week. 
My best friend rang me to tell me she is falling in love. I love the first moments of love. I live for it. The tales, the excitement, the total ecstasy. I can feel it, experience it just by hearing her through the phone. I have been jogging each day, swimming in the river every second. I‚Äôm trying to figure out a way to also include yoga and meditation into my daily practice again. Sometimes I find it hard to blend family life and one‚Äôs self. It‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm so immersed in one, I completely neglected the other and vice versa. 
Does the mother exist within one‚Äôs self,?
Or is one‚Äôs self seperate to the mother ?
This is something I ask frequently at the moment.
We had to let our rooster go because he kept attacking Zu, but than our friends gave us a new rooster and he is so cuddly and nice.
I find life works better when I just let go. 
My love for flowers keeps deepening and my
plant allies all over this beautiful planet just keep paving the way. Spring smells so good everywhere. 
Multitasking is such a disservice to me, but I keep doing it, how do I stop ? 
My Dad always said ‚Äòyou make your own fun‚Äô and it really is true. 
I‚Äôm learning to re write the word bored and replace it with peace. 
Nothing feels better than a really deep drawn out orgasm.

13699401,sallymustang,COByrFkJPZh,False,"How much happier would we be if we spent more time moving with the force of life? Dancing, singing, making love, feeling sexy, walking barefoot in the woods, floating down rivers, swimming in the ocean, growing flowers, eating from the garden, spotting animals, sharing stories and gazing at the moon - rather than always pushing ourselves along a path that we think is leading us to where we want to go?¬†Status, achievements, looking a certain way, Career, money, the next new ‚Äòthing‚Äô.. these are really quite unimportant when it comes to quality of life, but our minds are brainwashed. I suggest sitting, closing down your eyes and picture pulling your heart out of your chest and give it a big wash with sacred water. I pray daily: great spirit, help me live more in my heart. Let my heart open to the warmth magic which is life. The richness of truly living, the present moment is invaluable. 

We owe it to ourselves to acknowledge that our mind is so much smaller than feminine life force within us. As is the way most modern societies are living. Right now, a lot of us are closed in by fear. Fear for health (eat well, exercise, love yourself and cleanse your thoughts) fear of authority, fear of dying, fear of being seen, fear fear fear. We are living so SMALL! You know it if all of a sudden you do something that is stepping out of that fear-
We can taste the beginning of richness in something as simple as a naked cold water, river swim. This is the real path to living .  The divine feminine way which we all must find a way back to. For our planet. For our own survival. 
What if we were to let go of the expectations we had for ourselves, and just became more free to be. To have this human experience. To feel content with just living and loving?
