The Issue 😭: 
There’s SO MUCH more content to learn in uni than compared to high-school 📚
Furthermore, lecturers are often experts in their field, with years and years of experience, and when they get excited about what they’re teaching, they may go way way overboard, and share more than you need to know for your exams.

The Solution ✨: 
Focus on high-yield content. This is the content that will get you the most marks on your exam & assignments, and thus is the best use of your time.

You can find this through the learning objectives (usually at the start of each lecture or in your study guide) or by doing practice exams (as often the same questions/topics are repeated). 📝

An effective method I used was to turn each dot-point in the learning objectives into a question, then look through the lecture slides and other materials to answer the question, rather than reading every single page in the textbook or slides. ✅✅

The Hack: Cut your meetings 5-10min short, and use this time to send out a follow up email with actions! 📧 

Let’s face it. 
Most meetings go for longer than they should. By making your meetings shorter, you’ll be forced to get to the point, and more likely to keep people’s attention, already improving the productiveness of the meeting (and gaining you brownie points with your coworkers for giving them time back) 🤝🏽
 
But the real money-step of this hack comes from the follow up email. By sending this out IMMEDIATELY, you’re more likely to capture all the important points and it gives your coworkers more time to start working on what they were delegated. 🏆⏰
 
In this email include:
📧 Summary of what was discussed
📧 Decisions made
📧 Next steps (and for each next step, WHO is responsible for, and WHEN it should be completed by)

WHAT IS TIMED PRACTICE? ⏰ 
This is where you do practice exams under full exam conditions (eg without notes, complete silence, reading time if applicable and no breaks).

This is a MUST do when preparing for exams because: 
📕 It helps you learn how to APPLY the knowledge. You could memorise the whole textbook and still do poorly on the exam if you don’t learn how to respond to questions the way examiners want you to. 
This is why so many students often complain that they get questions on the exams that they weren’t prepared for or have never seen before.
Exam questions often don’t ask you to just regurgitate definitions word for word, instead they will present a real world example (and likely a new one every time) to see if you can apply your knowledge to solve the problem! 
By doing practice questions and comparing your exams to the marking scheme, you will develop this skill quickly, and be prepared for ANY question you could get. 

📕 It helps you perfect your exam technique. By replicating the exam conditions, you will develop your own rhythm in terms of what you do during reading time, how long you spend on each questions, what you do for questions you don’t know etc. 
This is a skill itself, entirely seperate from knowing the content, that needs to be developed. 

📕 It giving you an idea of how much time you have & how quick you need to be!! Exams can be long, and being able to pace yourself and stay focused for the entire duration is something that also needs to be developed with practice.

The Hack: SPACED REPETITION 📆
This is a highly effective revision technique where you review content at regular, increasing intervals. 

For example: 
Say you learn something in class that day.
You would then review the content… 
—> when you get home from school 
—> again that weekend 
—> the weekend after 
—> in a fortnight 
—> in a month 
—> in 3 months.

To take it one step further and make it even MORE effective, you should try to review using Active Recall, especially Practice Questions (eg from the textbook, past year papers). 

This will help you start perfecting your exam technique EARLY, help you commit the information to long-term memory, and understand the content on a deeper level.

So that when it comes to exam season, you won’t even NEED to revise because you’ll know everything!! ✅🏆💯

1️⃣ Be willing to give everything a go 🙋🏼‍♀️- if you haven’t done it before or unsure, don’t be scared to ask for help! Tell your supervisor that you’ll give it your best shot, but may need to be supervised or taught. 

A “can-do” attitude and an eagerness to learn is one of the best qualities to have. I constantly remind myself that I grow the most when I’m pushed out of my comfort zone, so the feeling of discomfort is actually something that I need to embrace. 

NOTE: this only refers to things that are inside the scope of your role & will help you develop. Be more cautious about saying yes to “busy work” just because your supervisor doesn’t want to do it.
.
2️⃣ Close the Loop 🔁- at the end of every meeting or conversation, report back what you understood as actions you need to do & by when. Then, as you complete those actions, report back to inform the person they are done & any other information that might be useful (eg if doing research, what the main findings were. If reaching out to someone, what their response was).

Similarly, if you need help with something/are stuck, or there is something blocking your progress, let them know too (eg “the contact is away on leave and will be back Monday, which is when I will follow up again”).

Don’t wait for them to have to chase you to figure out that the task has been done or has been held up.

Closing the loop helps build trust. It lets your supervisor know that you are reliable and they can delegate important tasks to you.

HOW TO STUDY EFFECTIVELY 🏆:
1️⃣ Use Active Study Methods - these are study methods that force you to engage with the content, doing some sort of physical or mental process. 🤓 

It leads to greater retention of info, understanding, and ability to apply theory! 
It also means that you can learn SO MUCH MORE in MUCH LESS time. ✅
.
Examples include:
🧠 Active Recall (e.g. Flashcards, Blurting, Application Questions)
🧠 Mind-Maps & Drawing Diagrams 
🧠 Teaching The Material to Others 
🧠 Loci Method 
🧠 Practice Exams 
.
2️⃣ Eliminate Distractions & Stay Focused - make sure you’re thinking only about the work in front of you to maximise retention. My favourite ways to do this are:
💯 Study Timelapse 
💯 Lofi-Beats & noise cancelling headphones 
💯 Quiet, low-stimulus environment (e.g. library, dedicated study room) 
💯 Chew gum (it actually works!)
💯 App Blockers/Downtime settings on your phone 
.
3️⃣ Plan Your Sessions - by planning your study sessions out before you start, you will be able to prioritise what needs to be done, stay on track, and even get additional benefits without more time studying!
.
To make sure your study session is the best it can be: 
⏰ Use time-blocking (allocate a set amount of time for each activity, to create a sense of urgency. Otherwise it will expand to fill the whole time)
⏰ Start with a quick-win (easy subject or small homework task)to get the dopamine flowing; then move onto your most challenging topic whilst energy levels & focus is still high 
⏰ Interleave your subjects by studying smaller blocks of multiple subjects rather than 1 big block of one subject (e.g. 1 hour each of Math, Science, English rather than 3 hours of Math). This will help you remember MORE and perform better on exams, as proven by research 👏🏽
