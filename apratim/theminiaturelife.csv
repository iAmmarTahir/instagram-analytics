@planbworksau 

📍 Mid week lazy dinner found us at Plan B in Crows Nest. Loved the laid back vibe with vintage comics on the wall and the American pub food. 

📍 We went with a Vego Burger, Hot Nashville Chicken Tenders and Waffle Fries topped with grilled onion and Plan B sauce. SO GOOD! Can’t wait to take a mate and try the Philly Cheesesteak!

📍 this loaf is probably the BEST result I have ever gotten with my sourdough. The bread was airy and so bubbly and honestly looked magnificent. Since I didn’t keep any from this bake I have had to rely on my friends for the feedback ❤️

📍 Comfort food at its absolute finest! Delicious prawns cooked in a rich spiced coconut gravy. This was the first recipe I taught in my cooking classes, and it’s a meal that I have such a special place for.

📍I like to use the prawn heads in the gravy base to develop the flavour. The flavour base also uses cashew and fennel to add a hint of sweetness and added richness to the prawns. Honestly it is such an iconic flavour profile - you won’t forget it!

📍 in other news - it’s Friday! I’m planning out my cooks for the weekend and a bread bake too. What’s on your schedule?

2964334905,theminiaturelife,CcCJFoYBB2_,True,"Let’a make Green Tea Eggs with @higher_living_australia 

I’ve used the Green Tea Chai teabags to make a really flavourful base for my tea eggs. This recipe is so easy and it’s a great way to dress up the humble boiled egg. 

All you need to do is make the flavour base by boiling (for 4 eggs)
• 1-2 cups of water
• 2 tbsp soy sauce
• 1-2 tea bags
• 2 bay leaves
• 1/2 inch stick of cinnamon
• 1/2 tsp Sichuan peppercorns
• 1 tsp of sugar
• pinch of salt

Then boil room temperature eggs for 7 minutes, and then remove and cool in an ice bath.

Crack the shells of the eggs (or remove completely) and place into a container. Pour over the prepared soy mixture (cooled) and set in the fridge for at least 12 hours. 

Serve with noodles or eat them plain - because they are delicious!
