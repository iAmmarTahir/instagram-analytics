The Matrix is one of my all time favourite movies. It came out 25 years ago, inspiring a whole generation of filmmakers, visual effects artists and stunt coordinators. 

This is my take on the iconic ‚Äúguns, lots of guns‚Äù scene where Neo & Trinity enter The Matrix to prepare for battle. I thought this would be a fun and innovative way of showcasing a furniture brand. Having different products from the @klekktic collection flying into the Matrix. 

To execute this @shravanraoo & I shot for a full 12 hours in a studio in Dubai. Heba, the founder of Klekktic, who plays Trinity in this video, helped coordinate all of the Klekktic pieces to be shipped to the studio. We then placed each item one by one filming the product and then removing it. This allowed us to create the effect of different pieces flying into place.

@Klekktic is a beautiful UAE based brand. They have a minimal design aesthetic that is clean and elegant. The best part about their products is they are customizable. For example, the desk at the start of the video I fully customized from a dining room table into an office desk with draws and storage. Bed sizes, table lengths, mirror finishings etc can all be customized to fit your space size and preference. 

My home project is really starting to take shape. It‚Äôs been a long time coming but it‚Äôs been worth the wait. More coming on that soon‚Ä¶

Special shout out to @shravanraoo who helped me film this and then worked on the kick ass visual effects.

I love challenging myself, and for this video I wanted to get creative by making a travel inspired piece of content but all from the Marina Home showroom in Dubai.

Travel is a huge part of my life, so when I learnt about the inspiration and international origins of Marina Home‚Äôs furniture it got me excited about making something fun that would highlight those countries and cultures. In this video there are 9 countries that are represented. Indonesia, Holland, France, Turkey, The UK, India, China, The US and Italy. Have a guess and drop a comment as to which is which. 

Setting up a new home is a very personal experience. Product choices and recommendations can come with lots of different opinions. That‚Äôs why I thought it would be fun to have ‚Äúmultiple Tom‚Äôs‚Äù in this video. Each Tom advising the other Tom on what furniture I should choose. There are so many different looks and vibes which makes it difficult as all the @MarinaHomeInteriors furniture is awesome! 

Bonus points for anyone who picked up on the Messi vrs Ronaldo chess scene. As soon as I saw that set up in the showroom I knew I had to bring out my inner football fan. 

From places to spaces we love, creating with @MarinaHomeInteriors has been a lot of fun. I hope you feel we‚Äôve been able to transform Marina Home‚Äôs showroom into a series of captivating travel destinations. Highlighting the rich diversity of their product offering as I traverse across various countries and cultures. Who‚Äôs interested in immersing themselves in the world of Marina Home?

Special shout out to @bramhansel who helped me make this.

26962743,tomjauncey,CyLpb0EJn1o,True,"What do you know about Venezuela? üáªüá™ 

Back in July I had the opportunity to spend a few weeks in Venezuela creating something special for @beautifuldestinations. 

As 2023 has been the year of AI, I‚Äôve been wanting to innovate and figure out a way to combine new immersive AI visuals with travel content. My thinking was that we‚Äôd be going to a place that not many people have seen before, Angel Falls in Canaima National Park, and if we could combine never before seen AI content with a truly out of this world destination then we‚Äôd have all the ingredients for something special. 

The first person I called was @andras.ra who‚Äôs been diving into short form AI content this year. We‚Äôve worked together a ton over the years and he‚Äôs an editing magician. The idea developed into a FPV Drone only concept where we‚Äôd play with generative AI to add little details into the video. @reme_martyr then joined the team to execute the aerials, he killed it! As the concept got bigger so did the team with @alexislefrene , @shravanraoo , @andres.visual and @bahaamalaeb joining the squad. 

What started as a fun idea turned into a full blown innovation project, looking to create the world‚Äôs first AI supported Tourism Campaign. By tapping into unique visual styles the hope was to create something that would make some noise and spark a conversation about the destination.

What you wouldn‚Äôt know is that 40 years ago my parents lived in Venezuela. At that time, Caracas was a global advertising hub. Ironically, my Dad was working in the same field that I am now. Back then he was one of the few photographers paving the way through dark room visual effects, that‚Äôs before photoshop existed! It was very cool to be there 40 years later trying to do something similar, as Venezuela announces itself as a new and exciting Tourism destination. I love the country‚Äôs new branding ‚Äúopen to the future‚Äù and I hope this video gives you a glimpse of that future as well as the future of content and where I think it‚Äôs going. 

This video is quite the rollercoaster so fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI wanted to create something fun in Dubai that would throw us back to the 70s. It‚Äôs a period of time that is so influential in today‚Äôs mainstream music and fashion worlds. To create that authentic feel I teamed up with Dubai based fashion designer @dianamuza_ to customize a handmade 70s outfit with all the materials and accessories coming from Deira. For the music I worked with internationally renowned DJ & Producer, @guest_cuts , to digitally remaster a vinyl track from the 70s to give the video that feel good disco vibe.

I love coming up with original ideas and doing things a little different. As the UAE was founded in 1971 I thought it would be fun to take a trip to the future!

For the last month I‚Äôve been doing Pilates with the awesome Gaby Noble founder of @exhalepilateslondon, as a way to improve my strength training. Prior to this year I had no idea what Pilates was and always thought of it as a workout for women. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong. 

As I wait for Project Apartment to get fully underway I‚Äôve turned my empty home into a Pilates Studio. This is just one of the many brutal exercises that are getting me lifting heavier than I ever have and feeling more recovered each day. 

There‚Äôs a big reason why a lot of elite male athletes, celebrities and performers have added Pilates to their training regimes üëáüèΩ

- Improves your muscle to mind connection. I am so focused on the movements and getting the muscles to do exactly what it needs to do. Something I never think about when weightlifting. 

- Improves core strength. Killer ab workout every single time!

- Helps me lift more, squat deeper, recover quicker, lets the joints and muscles breathe. This is why it‚Äôs been the perfect supplement to my strength training. 

- Limits injuries so I can keep pushing towards my goals without set backs. My flexibility and mobility has completely changed in 1 month. Again, allowing me to lift heavier, get stronger and recover faster. 

- Improves your posture & helps keep a healthy spine. Both are key for the work I do and ultimately make me move better and with more ease.

This is just the start of my Pilates journey but I‚Äôve been loving it so far with Gaby Noble @exhalepilateslondon . If you‚Äôre interested in trying it out shoot her a message. She‚Äôs the best in the space and trained the likes of Harry Styles, Kate Moss, Giancarlo Esposito & Christian Eriksen.
