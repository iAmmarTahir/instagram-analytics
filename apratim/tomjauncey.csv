November 2017 was the last time I posted a photo on Instagram! Since then I’ve been solely making videos with a focus on dreamlike aspirational content. I’d always be thinking video first and never picked up my camera to snap those special moments. 

I’m going to start being more active on Instagram as I’ve got something really special teed up for next month that’s going to push me to my limits 🤫. I want to get back to having fun with content and posting what I like vrs what I think might perform. That’s going to be a mix of photos, more raw in the moment content as well as the premium dreamlike stuff that I love.

The Matrix is one of my all time favourite movies. It came out 25 years ago, inspiring a whole generation of filmmakers, visual effects artists and stunt coordinators. 

This is my take on the iconic “guns, lots of guns” scene where Neo & Trinity enter The Matrix to prepare for battle. I thought this would be a fun and innovative way of showcasing a furniture brand. Having different products from the @klekktic collection flying into the Matrix. 

To execute this @shravanraoo & I shot for a full 12 hours in a studio in Dubai. Heba, the founder of Klekktic, who plays Trinity in this video, helped coordinate all of the Klekktic pieces to be shipped to the studio. We then placed each item one by one filming the product and then removing it. This allowed us to create the effect of different pieces flying into place.

@Klekktic is a beautiful UAE based brand. They have a minimal design aesthetic that is clean and elegant. The best part about their products is they are customizable. For example, the desk at the start of the video I fully customized from a dining room table into an office desk with draws and storage. Bed sizes, table lengths, mirror finishings etc can all be customized to fit your space size and preference. 

My home project is really starting to take shape. It’s been a long time coming but it’s been worth the wait. More coming on that soon…

Special shout out to @shravanraoo who helped me film this and then worked on the kick ass visual effects.

26962743,tomjauncey,CzHA81_Ji7m,True,"Showing you the world of @MarinaHomeInteriors 

I love challenging myself, and for this video I wanted to get creative by making a travel inspired piece of content but all from the Marina Home showroom in Dubai.

Travel is a huge part of my life, so when I learnt about the inspiration and international origins of Marina Home’s furniture it got me excited about making something fun that would highlight those countries and cultures. In this video there are 9 countries that are represented. Indonesia, Holland, France, Turkey, The UK, India, China, The US and Italy. Have a guess and drop a comment as to which is which. 

Setting up a new home is a very personal experience. Product choices and recommendations can come with lots of different opinions. That’s why I thought it would be fun to have “multiple Tom’s” in this video. Each Tom advising the other Tom on what furniture I should choose. There are so many different looks and vibes which makes it difficult as all the @MarinaHomeInteriors furniture is awesome! 

Bonus points for anyone who picked up on the Messi vrs Ronaldo chess scene. As soon as I saw that set up in the showroom I knew I had to bring out my inner football fan. 

From places to spaces we love, creating with @MarinaHomeInteriors has been a lot of fun. I hope you feel we’ve been able to transform Marina Home’s showroom into a series of captivating travel destinations. Highlighting the rich diversity of their product offering as I traverse across various countries and cultures. Who’s interested in immersing themselves in the world of Marina Home?

Special shout out to @bramhansel who helped me make this.

26962743,tomjauncey,CyLpb0EJn1o,True,"What do you know about Venezuela? 🇻🇪 

Back in July I had the opportunity to spend a few weeks in Venezuela creating something special for @beautifuldestinations. 

As 2023 has been the year of AI, I’ve been wanting to innovate and figure out a way to combine new immersive AI visuals with travel content. My thinking was that we’d be going to a place that not many people have seen before, Angel Falls in Canaima National Park, and if we could combine never before seen AI content with a truly out of this world destination then we’d have all the ingredients for something special. 

The first person I called was @andras.ra who’s been diving into short form AI content this year. We’ve worked together a ton over the years and he’s an editing magician. The idea developed into a FPV Drone only concept where we’d play with generative AI to add little details into the video. @reme_martyr then joined the team to execute the aerials, he killed it! As the concept got bigger so did the team with @alexislefrene , @shravanraoo , @andres.visual and @bahaamalaeb joining the squad. 

What started as a fun idea turned into a full blown innovation project, looking to create the world’s first AI supported Tourism Campaign. By tapping into unique visual styles the hope was to create something that would make some noise and spark a conversation about the destination.

What you wouldn’t know is that 40 years ago my parents lived in Venezuela. At that time, Caracas was a global advertising hub. Ironically, my Dad was working in the same field that I am now. Back then he was one of the few photographers paving the way through dark room visual effects, that’s before photoshop existed! It was very cool to be there 40 years later trying to do something similar, as Venezuela announces itself as a new and exciting Tourism destination. I love the country’s new branding “open to the future” and I hope this video gives you a glimpse of that future as well as the future of content and where I think it’s going. 

This video is quite the rollercoaster so fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride…

Special thanks to @vidafuria & @campamentouruyen

I’ve spent the last month practicing this dance sequence with the awesome @usher.dance 🕺🏽. This is the 5th time we’ve partnered up to create something special in Dubai. He’s a champion and coached me through the whole routine. 

A lot of you were expecting me to bust out some moves in the last “Back to the Future” video. Instead I thought it would be more fun to create a dedicated video that would pay homage to John Travolta’s iconic dance sequence in “Saturday Night Fever”. The song is from the movie as are the choreographed dance moves. Who remembers that legendary scene? 🍿 

This @visit.dubai campaign has been a lot of fun to make. I wanted to do something completely unique that would showcase the @museumofthefuture in a different way. I hope you’ve enjoyed this nostalgic throwback to the 70s. Should I bring the Time Machine back and showcase other periods of Dubai’s history?

Imagine time traveling from 1971 to 2071. That’s the idea behind this iPhone only video for @visit.dubai 

“I wanted to create something fun in Dubai that would throw us back to the 70s. It’s a period of time that is so influential in today’s mainstream music and fashion worlds. To create that authentic feel I teamed up with Dubai based fashion designer @dianamuza_ to customize a handmade 70s outfit with all the materials and accessories coming from Deira. For the music I worked with internationally renowned DJ & Producer, @guest_cuts , to digitally remaster a vinyl track from the 70s to give the video that feel good disco vibe.

I love coming up with original ideas and doing things a little different. As the UAE was founded in 1971 I thought it would be fun to take a trip to the future! The challenge was to create something unique, shot only on iPhone, that would juxtapose a retro vibe with a futuristic setting. There’s no better location in Dubai for a time machine than the Museum of the Future.

For the last month I’ve been doing Pilates with the awesome Gaby Noble founder of @exhalepilateslondon, as a way to improve my strength training. Prior to this year I had no idea what Pilates was and always thought of it as a workout for women. I couldn’t have been more wrong. 

As I wait for Project Apartment to get fully underway I’ve turned my empty home into a Pilates Studio. This is just one of the many brutal exercises that are getting me lifting heavier than I ever have and feeling more recovered each day. 

There’s a big reason why a lot of elite male athletes, celebrities and performers have added Pilates to their training regimes 👇🏽

- Improves your muscle to mind connection. I am so focused on the movements and getting the muscles to do exactly what it needs to do. Something I never think about when weightlifting. 

- Improves core strength. Killer ab workout every single time!

- Helps me lift more, squat deeper, recover quicker, lets the joints and muscles breathe. This is why it’s been the perfect supplement to my strength training. 

- Limits injuries so I can keep pushing towards my goals without set backs. My flexibility and mobility has completely changed in 1 month. Again, allowing me to lift heavier, get stronger and recover faster. 

- Improves your posture & helps keep a healthy spine. Both are key for the work I do and ultimately make me move better and with more ease.

This is just the start of my Pilates journey but I’ve been loving it so far with Gaby Noble @exhalepilateslondon . If you’re interested in trying it out shoot her a message. She’s the best in the space and trained the likes of Harry Styles, Kate Moss, Giancarlo Esposito & Christian Eriksen.

Here’s another Dragon encounter that you may not have seen yet. Last year I was very fortunate to work on the launch of HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon, streaming on OSN+. It was hands down one of the best experiences of my career, working on something that really pushed the boundaries from a marketing standpoint. 

I came up with a simple concept, “what if Dragons actually lived in today’s world and how would we interact with them?”

This video was shot at the iconic @habitasalula property in Saudi Arabia. Visuals from this pool were starting to blow up online as a bucket list hot spot due to its unique positioning in the desert, amongst a ton of crazy rock formations. We felt it was the perfect place for some Dragons to be lurking around 👀.

Huge thank you to the team @osn for trusting in the vision, to @filmalula & @experiencealula for their on the ground support, @habitasalula for allowing us to execute this idea, @itsprestonchen for shooting it with me and the awesome @krimium for the wow factor VFX edit.
