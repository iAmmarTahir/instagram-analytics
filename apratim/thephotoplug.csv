This time instead of a photo walk we’d like to get everyone together for a few hours of photography, food & fun under the sun. We did a BBQ about 3 years ago & it was a great time so we’d like to do this before our next walk.

We will be selling tickets for $5 just to cover the cost of food. There are only 40 spots available. Tickets go on sale today at 3:00pm, link in bio.
