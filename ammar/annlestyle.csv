At the beginning of our tour, our guide overwhelmed us with all the mathematical calculations and engineering ingenuity that went into building Angkor Wat. Certain points of the structure lined up perfectly with the Draco Constellation and the sun positioning at sunset. Although there are educated speculation from experts archeologists saying this dates back about 900 years ago, It‚Äôs all a mystery.

On the other hand, Spiritual channelers have mentioned this to be older than 5000 BC. It‚Äôs a place to activate the pineal gland (third eye) through frequencies, it‚Äôs also an informational point for earth to funnel data to and from other planets/galaxies. It‚Äôs like another access point of information like the great pyramids. The art carvings hold a lot of relations to Hinduism on many of the Angkor Park structures. But personally, I see a lot of psychedelic reflections on some of the temples. They almost look like what I see as the crossover realm between the mind and other outer dimensions. It‚Äôs like the level where you have to overcome the ego before connecting with your higher self. Very interesting place to walk around and wander off into.

This town is 2 hrs south of Saigon - which around $40 Grab ride.  The town itself is pretty developed as in roads and sidewalks, but this is where you can relax from the crazy traffic and roads of Saigon. I think Ben Tre fits the criteria of what many people think of Saigon. It‚Äôs a growing city, with no crazy developments, or high rise.  Many restaurants or stores here cater to the locals, so you will get more of an authentic experience. The locals are pretty friendly as long as you are respectful. The kids like to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù to my bf because they want to use their English. They get a good chuckle when he says ‚Äúhi‚Äù in Vietnamese. We usually greet and thanks in the language of the country we‚Äôre in, many folks seem to appreciate it.  The young locals speak English well, older people usually don‚Äôt. 

We did 3 tours here with @mrbikerbentreboattour , Troy found him on TripAdvisor. We highly recommend his tours. After doing our first private boat tour, we came back for another tour of the town, and then rented bikes from one of the eco lodges/homestays. @mrbikerbentreboattour has been extremely punctual and helpful with us. His tours gives you a sample of the local lifestyle and Vietnamese tradition. We‚Äôve got to visit the small canals off the Mekong river, and private roads of the locals. We did not experienced any upsell, pressure to buy, or nonsense stops on the tours. It felt more educational and you can see the aunties and uncles on his team working diligently to make a good impression for us. We really appreciated our stay here.

As we walked, we discovered more street foods, mini restaurants, and cafes. I got some sugarcane juice off an auntie from a side stall and then stumbled into a little oasis off a super busy bustling road. It was a little coffee stale with lots of unique and local plants surrounding it. Great place for coffee and plant enthusiasts ü™¥ There were little tables and seats hidden around an array of hanging plants. Later I found out it was a plant shop too!

I thought that crowded places gives me anxiety but what I learned is that the environment and people affect me. Crowded places don‚Äôt give me anxiety, the collective energy of the same things do. Sometimes my environment can feel like a drag. People talking about the same things, focused on career, status, gossip, politics, limited beliefs, problems after problems. And when I‚Äôm around it too much, it sucks the life force out of me, so I retract. Exploring helps me break free from that. Any sort of traveling, mini trips, or taking off on a plane helps me break free from monotony and repetition. Walking in places is also very grounding for me.
