239809137,alexhonnold,C1cdrARJUcq,False,"As we approach the end of year, I wanted to share a quick update on all things @honnoldfoundation. I know I say this every year, but, really, it’s pretty incredible to see how HF’s work has evolved over time. I got a chance to read through a report that highlighted some of our Partners’ impacts in the last few years, and it got me fired up. Just one example – in the last three years, our projects have built solar infrastructure in 245 communities with the potential to impact over 180,000 people. 

Meanwhile, the solar infrastructure we’ve helped install is enough to cover 9 acres worth of rooftops, which is honestly quite a bit.

But maybe the most eye popping stat was this: In the last three years, we’ve received far more projects than we could fund. If we had funded every single project submitted to us, we’d have brought solar to nearly 1.8 million people.

I’m proud of the work we’ve done, and I also know that there’s plenty more to do.

To everyone who supports our work at the Honnold Foundation, thank you! It’s really making a significant impact for people around the world.   And, if you’re considering and able to make an end of year donation towards climate action and social justice, I’d really appreciate you thinking of us at the Honnold Foundation. My own giving supports our team’s overhead, so every dollar that you give goes directly towards the communities we support – and all of those impacts I just mentioned.

Whether you can afford a little or a lot - all I ask is that you approach it a bit like a climbing project: make a gift that challenges you – something not too easy, but don’t go bankrupt or anything, either. Just make a gift that you can be proud of.

Anyways, hope you and your family have a nice holiday season!
