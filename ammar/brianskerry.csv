Happy World Whale Day!
 
A window into rarely seen beluga whale social culture in the Canadian Arctic.
 
Traveling hundreds of kilometers each summer to reach their ‘favorite beach,’ beluga whales play in the shallow water of an estuary.
 
Newborn calves can be seen swimming alongside their moms.

A little Sea Turtle Love for #ValentinesDay!
 
Mating Green Sea Turtles within the Buck Island National Marine Monument in St. Croix. Sea turtle conservation has been a priority at Buck Island for decades and the results have been substantially increasing numbers of Green, Hawksbill and Leatherback sea turtles.

Two photos of Common Terns bringing back fish for their chicks that tell a story of climate change in the Gulf of Maine –
 
As seawater temperatures increase, native fish species that sustain seabirds become scarce, forcing parents to bring their chicks fish that they cannot swallow.
 
In the first image the parent returns to its nest with a Sand Lance – a slender-bodied silver fish that the chicks can easily swallow.
 
The second photo shows a tern parent with a Butterfish in its mouth, a meal the baby birds cannot eat.
 
The result is an increase in chick mortality rates.

Sea Smoke rises from the ocean water near Whaleback Light, a historic lighthouse in Kittery, Maine. Temperatures on this morning in February 2023 were minus 12-degrees F, not accounting for wind chill and the gale force winds were blowing.

A harp seal pup, about 16 days old swims among the ice in Canada’s Gulf of St. Lawrence.
 
At about age 14 days, these pups shed their white coats and begin learning to swim. At this stage they are called “beaters” a name derived from the way they beat the water with their flippers.
 
The loss of sea ice due to climate change is negatively impacting these animals.

A school of Alewife fish swim into a waterfall during their annual spawning migration in a river in Maine.
 
Alewife are an anadromous species of herring that spend most of their lives in the ocean, but migrate through freshwater rivers to lakes where they spawn each spring.
 
Their stocks had been severely depleted, but have improved in the Gulf of Maine due to the removal of dams in coastal rivers.

Feels like a Mako Shark Monday …
 
Do you agree?
 
 
The Shortfin Mako Shark is one of the fastest fish on Earth and can also jump out of the water to great heights.
 
Due to heavy fishing pressure, this species is classified as vulnerable to extinction.
 
The black, thread-like objects in the mouth of this animal are parasites, which are commonly found on sharks.
