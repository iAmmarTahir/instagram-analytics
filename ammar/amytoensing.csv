63342087116,inheritance_thefilm,C2a2RY5uiK4,True,"TOMORROW our film INHERITANCE (@inheritance_thefilm) will have a second showing at Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.

INHERITANCE tells the story of an often overlooked America and a family caught in the grips of intergenerational trauma and addiction. Filmed over 11 years in one Appalachian town the film follows a boy as he grows up from age 12 to 18 surrounded by chaos, addiction and powerful love.

We want the film to fuel conversations, provide space for empathy and break stigmas around substance abuse and mental health.

We are so appreciative to our Editor Curtis Whitear (@curtiswhitear), our Composer Kyle Scott Wilson (@kyle_scott_wilson) and our Executive Producers Morgan Pehme and Daniel DiMauro (@dan__dimauro), Sam Cullman, Erik (@e1heyer) and Leslie Heyer, and Dave A. Liu (@liucrative).

I need my equipment to be really good on so many levels, including that it helps celebrate the story I am working to tell.⁠
⁠
A few years ago I needed a computer screen and I asked my friend @aboutrc (who is really smart about gear) what to get and he introduced me to the folks at BenQ. They sent me a screen to try and from then on I’ve been hooked. I’m proud to say I have since become an official ambassador! ⁠Thankful for a screen that reflects and celebrates what I saw.

I was asked if I had an idea for a project and I proposed Monhegan – a small island 10 miles off the coast of Maine. I am from New England and had lived on the Maine coast as a young adult. I had always been curious about the 2 mile long and ½ mile wide island. In the summers the place overflows with tourists, but the year round population is only about 60-70. The islanders’ de facto fishing territory became the Monhegan Lobster Conservation Area in 1996 with a limited season starting in October. The island’s windswept landscape, quirky community and the dramatic cliffs have inspired artists like Robert Henri, George Bellows, Rockwell Kent, Edward Hopper, Lynn Mapp Drexler and three generations of the Wyeth family to name a few. ⁠

The community took me in and sometimes chewed me up. My time and experiences there changed and shaped my life in profound and beautiful ways that continue to impact me almost 25 years later; working with photo editor Susan Welchman who took me under her wing and has been my mentor and dear friend since and within days of arriving to the island, I also met one of my best friends @tralice_pooltoyphotos ⁠
