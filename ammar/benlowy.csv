This are images from an old project from 2002.
The project was born out of one of the most traumatic experiences I had as a journalist - and it is - in a way - the beginning of my career.

In the Summer of 2002 I traveled to Israel and the West Bank and Gaza - fresh out of school hoping to find my way into the industry. I did whatever naive kid did back then, and parachuted my way into a story that I had little nuanced appreciation for. 

In the midst of trying to document life in Hebron between the Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents, I was beaten by a mob of 20 Jewish settlers during a violent funeral/riot in the center of the city. Interestingly enough an Israeli soldier was also beaten by the settler mob. 

I lost all my photography equipment I had saved up for, driving the “drunk bus” route in school, and dislocated my shoulder, and fractured my elbow and knee.

My mentor at the time - James Colburn (the DC bureau photo editor for Time Magazine) told me I couldn’t leave. That if I left - “I would always be scared” 

So I stayed - and he shipped me some old Nikon F3s he had lying in his office.

I spent the next month looking for a different story, and I found it in the most cliche place - A mental institution.

There was an old geriatric wing of this psychiatric facility in Bethlehem. For patients from all over the country. The doctors said some were Jewish, some were Muslim, some were Christian. No one knew for sure, many had been dropped off as infants. The facility had originally been administered by German, then British, then TransJordanian, then Israel and at the time I was there - the Palestinian Authority. 

And it was filled with many patients. They were all psychologically damaged or impaired. But interestingly enough - they got along with each other.

They were insane. But at peace.
And everyone outside was sane, but waging war.

Makes you think about who is really in their right minds.

I was down on the border in #eaglepass TX covering hopeful and desperate migrants crossing the Rio Grande. Most were coming from Venezuela. Many had been on the road for over a year. The infant had been born while on the road. The definition of a stateless refugee. 
And the last leg of their desperate trip was a raging river, and a shore filled with concertina razor wire and armed National Guard. 
The US border patrol would cut the wire that the National Guard put up to let people in. Children and women first, then men. 

My dad came through Ellis Island as a child, and never had to face what these people have.

I ended up getting a lot of editorial sports work post Iraq/Afghanistan - it really helped me process in some ways. Getting peak action, standing on the sidelines in relative safety. The spectacle of tailgating and the cult of personalities.

4928907,benlowy,C2F4XSSxakL,False,"One of the other projects I did in Yemen were these portraits of Yemenis that played into the assignment I was working on, along with people I met during wanderings around different cities. 

This project could be the indirect reason I was detailed when I came back to the US. 

The second image is a portrait of the leader (at the time) of Al Qaeda’s political wing in Yemen.  He really liked the image and asked if I could send it to him. We used the old “bump” iPhone app to exchange the image. And I’m pretty sure my phone was compromised from there on out. 

To make matters worse - we were meeting in a large cafe for safety - the next interview subject came in to meet the writer and I a bit early. The third image is a portrait of the last Rabbi in Yemen. Obviously the head of Al Qaeda and the Rabbi kept their affiliations on the DL - so neither knew who each one was. They actually exchanged pleasant greetings and traded places - as the rabbi stayed for an interview and portrait.

The fourth image is a former Guantanamo prisoner who was returned to Yemen after serving a few years in the prison and found either not guilty or not worth US efforts to interrogate him. He was unemployed and trying to figure out how to continue a life cut short.
