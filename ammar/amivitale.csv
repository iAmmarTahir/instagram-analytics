Moving a black rhino, an animal weighing over a ton, is a Herculean challenge fraught with danger at every turn. It begins with the risky task of sedating the massive creature, a procedure that requires precision and caution to ensure both the rhino’s safety and that of the vets and handlers. Once subdued, the real test begins as the sedated rhino must be carefully revived and maneuvered into a sturdy crate, a task made all the more daunting by the animal’s immense size and strength. Every step of this delicate operation underscores the inherent risks involved. Watch the sheer force of these creatures and imagine doing it over 21 times over the course of 2 weeks.

492356095,amivitale,C3Q5LIOxNPH,False,"I am humbled to share another remarkable conservation story from Kenya: the resurgence of eastern black rhinos from the brink of extinction. In a pivotal moment, Kenya is reclaiming its role as a haven for these creatures, establishing a vital breeding population at @Loisaba_Conservancy in Laikipia, Kenya, where they have been absent for the past half-century mainly due to poaching and long ago,  trophy hunting. This first image shows the moment a rhino was resuscitated after it stopped breathing and quickly released. The arduous tasks of tracking, darting, and relocating 21 of these critically endangered giants, each weighing over a ton, posed formidable challenges, yet the teams from @kenyawildlifeservice executed the operation with unparalleled expertise and dedication. Their efforts offer a glimmer of hope for the future of these magnificent creatures. The final image shows the skull of the last rhino poached in the 1970s resting beneath a celestial canopy, symbolizing this hopeful shift as Kenya now stands  as a nation that is expanding habitat and bolstering rhino populations. With approximately 80% of the world's remaining eastern black rhinos under its protection, Kenya is safeguarding endangered populations for future generations.

They successfully conducted an in vitro embryo transplant in a southern white rhino, resulting in a pregnancy—a crucial proof of concept. However, the joy was short-lived as unforeseen tragedy struck due to heavy rainfall and flooding, unearthing Clostridia bacteria spores and leading to a devastating infection that claimed both the mother, Curra, and the 70 day old fetus.

Despite this profound loss, the team remains determined, having worked tirelessly for years to create 30 embryos with Avantea lab.

492356095,amivitale,C2k3j-NRgX6,False,"This awe-inspiring creature was a 70-day-old rhinoceros fetus, an embodiment of perfection in its miniature form. While a typical southern white rhino can tip the scales between 3,080 and 7,920 pounds and 11-15 feet, this little one only reached a delicate 6.4 inches. His life was cut short when his surrogate mother, Curra, a southern white rhino, succumbed to an unforeseen tragedy triggered by heavy rainfall and flooding that unearthed Clostridia bacteria spores, leading to a swift and devastating infection.

The news of Curra's demise struck the team with profound grief. These dedicated individuals have been tirelessly working for years to rescue the northern white rhinos from the brink of extinction. Their journey brought them to Kenya, where they were on the verge of confirming the success of creating the world's first rhino pregnancy through embryo transfer at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy. In a bittersweet twist of fate, the entire team received word of the successful pregnancy by implantation of an embryo using in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, this moment of joy was tinged with the somber acknowledgment of the journey's cost. The next pivotal step is to transfer northern white rhino embryos into a surrogate mother.

I'll be sharing more of this extraordinary story in the coming weeks.  Stay connected with the @biorescue_project, @safariparkdvurkralove, @leibnizizw, @olpejeta, #avantea, and @kenyawildlifeservice for more insights into this pivotal moment for northern white rhinos.
