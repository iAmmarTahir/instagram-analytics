269307852,ashimashiraishi,C1KoHYLJgxH,False,"Snippets from the woodworking studio with Yoshida-san @monkeyhold_japan in 大垣 (Ogaki), Japan over the summer. 

Shaping these holds was a lesson in allowing the medium lead to the final form rather than having the mind dictate the outcome. The practice was about inhibiting the urge to mold the wood into a shape I had pre-envisioned; instead, surrendering to the wood, imagining how best to reveal its beauty and unique form. 

To hold something is gratifying, but the more I climb, the more curious I become about the entire ecosystem that holds the boulders. When examined more closely, the 侘寂 of the wood is unveiled through the imperfections of the gnarled knots, the layers and swirls of age lines that hold the stories of the tree the wood came from 🤍 🌳

Overjoyed to have poured my heart into those 100 miles of rolling hills atop the beautiful contours of deeply red, iron-rich port silt loam (the Oklahoma state soil). Was severely unprepared for this much mileage in the saddle but the company of my favorite human @davidblennox and the soundtrack from my favorite anime, Yowamushi Pedal, carried me through when the winds blew heavily against our chests and faces. Some of the rougher moments were assuaged by words of wisdom I recalled from the night before spoken by @arya_samsarya. ⭐️ Right when my legs felt like bursting on a never ending upward hill, i was reminded of her tip to use the momentum from the downhill to propel myself into the tiresome ascent ⛰️ sadly, my passion for climbing rocks did not translate to climbing hills, hence the need for tactics to compensate.

🌱I’ve been fascinated by this form of textile art for quite some time but never took the initiative to experiment w it till this year. In a conversation w my mom about folk art in Japan, the topic of this ancient method of manual resist dying came up and her eyes instantly sparkled with excitement as she shared her story of working with dye in her youth. As a child to immigrant parents who are reserved in speaking of their past, i have a hazy idea of what they were like in their youth and the environment in which they grew up in. Anyways, I love how shibori became a catalyst to paint a more vivid picture of my mom’s past 🌿It felt extra special to learn some shibori techniques from my mom with dear friends💖 

Some quotes I love from master dyer Fukumi Shimura: 

“I have received color without limit from the natural world in the years since I entered the dyer’s way. It has poured down on me endlessly, too much for this meager vessel to hold. Joyful as a child with a new set of paints, I have woven and woven yarn dyed by the grasses and trees”. 

“I don’t tell the acorn or gardenia seed pod or plum bar what color I want – I listen to the voice of the plants.” 

Hope I get the chance to practice and learn from the shibori masters in Japan soon 🎨",24,4348,1676674090,,https://scontent-lhr6-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/331346488_1214464859175898_1119273085437388448_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr6-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=H4cz26YDwjwAX9enfvB&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBkK1Tm131JP6Y02nCQHV-FMC0gvsoddkv9K5qLt9il1w&oe=65E9E5F6&_nc_sid=8b3546,True
269307852,ashimashiraishi,CldCiH7rcpr,False,"Malibu is also a word of Chumash origin, which is the name given to groups of California Indians that lived around the south-central coast. Chumash is derived from Tcú-mac, a word used by the Coastal Chumash to refer to Santa Rosa Island natives. Before the Spanish arrived, Chumash natives lived along the coast from San Luis Obispo to Malibu Canyon, and as far east as the edge of San Joaquin Valley.

November is Native American Heritage Month in the US and a time to celebrate and honor the rich and diverse cultures, traditions, histories and to acknowledge the important contributions of Native people. It’s also a great time to learn more about Native people and how tribal citizens are working to move beyond these challenges. I’m grateful to be part of the collective effort of the #arcteryx athlete team to share the stories of the original caretakers and names of places that are special to each of us. We are hoping that by acknowledging the first stewards, amplifying the past and current impact of Indigenous stewardship, we can help to begin to undo the erasure caused by the renaming of important places.

Lao Tzu once said, “Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong”. 

Water being soft and strong reminds me of the soft power of storytelling. Here’s one story: 
before Los Angeles was even a word on a map, it was called Tovaangar, the territory of the Tongva, Chumash and Kizh, who were then enslaved to build the San Gabriel Mission and San Fernando Mission. It may be unsettling to realize but urban areas that have become so ingrained in our collective consciousness as “American” were once native land, too.

It’s a windy channel of conglomerate rock that acts like a barrier from the turbulence of civilization. There’s a canopy of cottonwoods and live oaks scattered about. Rattlers basking in the sun. A honeycomb mounted in a hueco. A flow of creek water cascades down and through the rock piles. Further down the stream, a face of cobblestone rocks- purple, green, brown, red- protruding upon a beige sandy looking canvas.

There’s a busy road a hundred feet above; honking and roadside noise remind us that this respite is in close proximity to a bustling city. But then the gurgling water overwhelms the sound of motor vehicles emanating from above, dislodging you from the constraints of spatial and temporal associations, you can almost close your eyes and forget where you are.
