This is Legadema, the star of our film Eye of the Leopard. We spent over three years filming and documenting her growth from wide-eyed cub to confident huntress. She let us into her secretive world and helped fuel our passion to protect Africa's threatened wild cats. Although Legadema is no longer with us, her legacy lives on. This #WorldWildlifeDay, we're reflecting on the special time we spent with her, and renewing our dedication to protect our planet's precious wild species and spaces.⁣

290636851,beverlyjoubert,C4A7ZecLWP-,False,"Battles between lions and buffaloes are unpredictable, brutal and intense. Adult male African buffaloes can weigh over 900 kilograms and they are notoriously belligerent. It takes careful coordination, acute timing and immense courage for lions to successfully hunt these massive animals. Often when the fight appears to be nearing its conclusion, a final show of strength from the buffalo – sometimes backed by the rest of the herd – can swing the odds in its favour. Sadly, for this bull, his resilience was overpowered and the lions succeeded.⁣

This young male was surprisingly tolerant of the rough-and-tumble games initiated by the pride's smallest members. For the cubs, playtime – which is most of the time – is an opportunity to learn and discover. For this subadult male who became the unwilling victim of their exuberant pouncing, it's a lesson in patience.⁣

Their movements are purposeful and intricate fuelled by an intelligence and social cohesion that we are yet to fully understand.

Specially adapted vocal folds allow these cats to muster up a reverberating bellow that can be heard from kilometres away.

It's a sound we've come to love and appreciate during our time documenting these apex predators. Sadly, we have also witnessed this iconic sound fading from more and more corners of the African wild. We stand to lose so much more than just a roar if we allow these cats to vanish.⁣

Intensely focused, this cheetah gives a piercing gaze across the plains of Kenya’s Masai Mara. Among Africa’s iconic big cats, cheetahs stand out as perhaps the most stark example of threats converging to imperil a species—from shallow gene pools to habitat loss to the illegal trade. New and emerging issues, including some related to climate change, are adding to the pressure—and often unfolding in unexpected ways. Recent research, for example, shows that rising temperatures are pushing cheetahs to shift their hunting habits to the cooler night hours, a behavior that not only complicates their survival strategies but also intensifies competition with other carnivores. In the face of these complex challenges, it is crucial for us to recognize the urgency of conservation efforts for both cheetahs and precious ecosystems like the Masai Mara.",6,1324,1708431945,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/429173168_363401906500779_9024697928548953769_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=ZQiG20gcG_oAX_s32f5&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB-X4MpBWlr4byjysGXPI5phUaVLp0hQq4E8MkHvephgg&oe=65E9C8A9&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
290636851,beverlyjoubert,C3c4Kz8rpbN,False,"Spotting a pangolin in the wild is rare. In all our years documenting wildlife, often spending weeks embedded in the bush, we've only seen a handful of these elusive mammals in the wild. They're often more active at night, shuffling through the undergrowth in search of termites, ants and larvae, which they dig out of nests and burrows using their impressive claws. Once they've carved an opening in the dirt, a long sticky tongue goes to work sucking up insects en masse. ⁣
⁣
They are profoundly unique animals. But they are also under threat. All eight species of pangolins found throughout the world are threatened by the illegal wildlife trade and populations are rapidly declining. Despite their shy nature, they remain one of the most trafficked mammals in the world and are illegally trapped in their thousands to feed a growing demand for their scales and meat. Without strict regulations and enforcement, these remarkable animals may be pushed to extinction. This #WorldPangolinDay, let's join forces and pledge to never let that happen.⁣

Ten long years where the youngster may encounter shrinking habitats, altered landscapes, and malicious humans. If the calf makes it, he’ll have an important role to play in helping nurture the next generation of elephants – a generation that may face even greater threats. These giants need safe space to roam in protected landscapes where they can live in harmony with humans. ⁣

Although they spend the majority of the daylight hours basking, semi-submerged, in rivers or ponds, hippos venture out of the water at night or when the weather is cooler to feed on grass. Those dainty ankles are carrying around a ton and a half of territorial hippo and, despite his size, he can turn on a dime. Deeply scarred from territorial disputes – the wounds of which were likely made more severe by opportunistic oxpecker birds that feast on blood and parasites – this male clearly means business. Hippos are famously possessive over their pools and will aggressively defend them, sometimes even charging at innocuous animals like impalas. A herd of buffalo ventured a bit too close, and the enraged hippo voiced his displeasure at their presence. Although buffaloes can definitely hold their own against an aggressive hippo, this herd thought  better of taking on the challenge and instead watched the angry behemoth from a distance.⁣⁣
