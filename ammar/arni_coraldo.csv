7208716,arni_coraldo,CyzGCPDPUl3,True,"Daniel Robinson is one of those rare artists you meet that are just the real deal, as in: artist to the core‚Ä¶ smart dude, inspiring words, no bullshit, master of his craft, living a humble life in rural Fossil, Oregon with his family, guitar, and a tiny messy backyard studio to paint at night. I‚Äôve known Daniel for a long time, we shared gallery representation at Charles Hartman Fine Art in PDX for 16 years and I always admired him for his dedication to his craft. We were so fortunate to photograph and film him for our latest @dannerboots Go There series. My hot wife @alynicklas directed and shot this video but it took a village to create the video and stills. Huge thanks to our team below!
