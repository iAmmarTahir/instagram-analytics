9014131,bethanyhamilton,CyMfNWPOqa9,True,"This month marks 20 years since one of the most impactful moments of my life when a shark took my arm while on a surfing off the coast of Kauai, my birth place. Many people could look at the incident back in 2003 as a major setback for me, but God had so much in store for the future! 🤙🏼

It’s absolutely wild to think how my life started and where it is now and all the amazing yet challenging things in between. I didn’t wake up in the hospital thinking I was invincible and was gonna get back to surfing. After getting a hint of inspiration,  I had to dream it up, flip my mindset and be willing to do what I had not seen anyone else do.  This was a challenge to live in faith. And I am so glad I was willing to try and give it my best shot! 🙏🏼 Now I get to surf with my two eldest sons Tobias and Wesley and my hubby! I get to enjoy these sweet moments with my newborn daughter. There is so much to be grateful for, and these past 20 years have been filled with incredible moments and huge overcoming seasons. 💛

When you have your “Shark Attack” moments in life. I hope you’re willing to try, and give life your best shot! You too CAN OVERCOME!",6429,952787,1696891226,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/417168400_746732974013673_1901838901964349449_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=RPqmnqcDMQsAX_YqL8F&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBRzuXbfaPaewaDtkH4ECnffz4rciWIS68Wn_YRJfWNYQ&oe=65E71B30&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
9014131,bethanyhamilton,Ch22aytK15V,True,"Changing your mindset is free. Doesn’t mean it’s an easy or fast fix. It’s up to you to be honest with yourself and start working on it. 
It’s wild to me that some people still think surfing with one arm is not possible. I am a living example and there are soooo many other amazing adaptive athletes and people out there doing incredible things that people perceive as impossible. 
What is it about some who are willing to adapt and make the most of what they’ve got? 
MINDSET. It may take time to switch it up and we may have to be forever workin at it. But I promise you, that you won’t regret continually flipping your mind to be more grateful, more optimistic, more of what and how can can I do this life to the best of my abilities… More of - I don’t need easy I just need possible. 🧠✨💪🏽 Hope this pushes you today and onward to adapt in your life. YOU CAN.

9014131,bethanyhamilton,C3d4pqUPn_6,True,"Do yall struggle with motivation? 
Getting a workout in as mom can be a beast! But what I be found that works for me is adjusting my expectations. 
I’ve lowered my expectations to know that I will be interrupted and I may loose my flow here and there. 

Buttt in exchange, I invite my children into the space! They get to see mom taking care of herself and getting filled in a way. And they move too! We play a lot in the yard as well.
I really like having strength and it satisfies a need that I have. And it helps me to be more efficient in motherhood and in surfing! 
Motivation may come and go but having your “why” can help carry you through the years. Also making sure your eating enough and getting proper rest so that you can have energy to stay motivated at whatever it me be that you do! 

Also when it comes to fitness and movement you do not need a fancy gym. Just a bit of motivation and creativity. There is so much free info online now days or get hiking in nature!

We eat a more traditional diet. Bone broth, organ meats, high protein, eggs, potatoes and squashes, raw local dairy, and fruits! Plus some grain often in sourdough form. 
When you own the kitchen, you own your health.
Truth is you gotta own the kitchen in order to direct your health. It may not be perfect and you don’t have to do fancy. Most of our meals can be created in about 20 minutes but they are not lacking in nutrients.
