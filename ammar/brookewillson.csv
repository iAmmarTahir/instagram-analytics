235175071,brookewillson,CkjGRjkPFjq,False,"Hey üëãüèº It‚Äôs me. I know there‚Äôs a lot of new faces around here so I thought I‚Äôd do a little ‚ÄòTen Random Facts About Me‚Äô: 

1) I am 31. Born in Red Deer, Alberta. I‚Äôve been here my entire life and don‚Äôt think I ever move. My husband is stuck here now üè° 
2) I have both my Social Work and Education degree. I‚Äôve been working in schools for 14 years now. Currently as a substitute teacher. My second SW practicum placement was in an alternative school, and I just fell in love with it. 
3) Before dogs I raised bunnies. My last bunny was 7 years ago, Peanut. He lived in my school office. The students loved him! 
4) I have travelled to 25 countries: Canada, US, Mexico, Nicaragua, Chile, Peru , Bolivia, Argentina, Italy, France, Spain, Czech, Greece, Vatican City, Iceland, Sweden, Ireland, Switzerland, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Tanzania, and Egypt. Next up is Scotland! 
4) I hate deep cleaning, don‚Äôt really know how to do clean. Luckily my hubby doesn‚Äôt mind. I do vacuum, and do the laundry though I am extremely tidy üòÇ
5) I have naturally very curly hair but haven‚Äôt worn it that way in 4 years. My husband hasn‚Äôt even seen it. I wash it every 5-7 days depending and it‚Äôs just easier to straighten and curl it. 
6) I had a MASSIVE Beanie Baby collection, thought they‚Äôd be worth millions and I‚Äôd be able to retire on it. Turns out they ain‚Äôt. 
7) I have 3 sisters, none of us look anything alike and yes we have the same parents üòÖ 
8) I am allergic to horses, cats, and dogs that shed. Growing up I always wanted to be a veterinarian, but allergies would‚Äôve got in the way of that haha. They never went away. 
9) I had a paper route growing up. I did the same route every day for 7 years. Grade 3-10. After all those years of delivering papers we don‚Äôt have a single photo to show for it. I was out there in all sorts of weather. On my bike in the summer or head to toe in my snow suit. It was outside the city and driveways were long and far apart. 
10) I fear the ocean and drowning. I hate waves. Along with avalanches. These fears keep me from surfing along with backcountry skiing. I also hate small spaces. Claustrophobia is a real thing ü´£

Whether I‚Äôm heading out on a long trail run,or paddle, trekking to an off-road viewpoint to capture a photo, or hunting for a camping spot, it‚Äôs important to have a vehicle that‚Äôs just as rugged as the adventure.

235175071,brookewillson,C30Fj8hr0ZJ,True,"As a traveler it can be hard to tell whether or not an attraction or activity is harmful to any animals, or we may be too caught up in the excitement of the experience to recognize the reality of what indeed is happening. 

Here are a few things you can ask yourself to avoid cruel attractions: 
1) Are the wild animals kept in cages that do not have all of the following: food, clean water, shelter, ample space, privacy and enrichment?
2) Are animals forced to perform tricks in shows?
3) Are you able to ride, touch, hold, walk or swim with wild animals? 
4) Does the tourist attraction sell parts of products from wild animals? 
5) Does the tour company chase or lure wild animals closer with food or bring people too close to wild animals so they can see them better?

 If you answered yes to any of these, it is not an animal-friendly attraction. Also if the attraction claims to have rescued the wild animals under their care, you can use @worldanimalprotectioncanada‚Äôs checklist, to determine if it is a genuine sanctuary.

A couple of points pulled from the checklist are:
1) Does not take animals from the wild (unless they are injured) or breed animals 
2) Does not keep wild animals to make a profit
3) Keeps animals in enclosures that closely resemble their natural habitat and give them enough space and opportunities to move and behave naturally
4) Have veterinarians available at any hour to treat the animals that become sick or hurt. 

 I have linked the checklist in my bio, along with in my stories if you‚Äôre wanting to read more.
