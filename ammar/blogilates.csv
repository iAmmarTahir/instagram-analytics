145441810,blogilates,C4CFSZwxXa1,True,"Product development is long and often frustrating. When you watch my videos, you see the sketch then you see the final result in a matter of 60 seconds but the truth is often my designs take anywhere between a year to sometimes 3 years to go from concept to real thing. 

Why?

It all begins with finding the right fabric for what I‚Äôm trying to achieve. If I‚Äôm lucky, I may already have a fabric I love that I‚Äôve used before that I wanna use again! But often the fabric sourcing bit itself can take months.

The sampling process can take anywhere from a few months minimum to almost a year, sometimes more! During this time, fabric can change, design may change, the perfect fit will always be obsessed over, and I‚Äôll sample over and over and over again until it feels just right. I‚Äôll won‚Äôt stop until it feels ready, and I‚Äôm happy.

Then there‚Äôs the actual production which includes the weaving of the fabric, the dying of the fabric, the cutting of the pattern pieces, the careful sewing of the garment etc etc‚Ä¶

Good things just take time. 

They seem to always do, don‚Äôt they?

My obsession with ballerinas begins with their ability to look so graceful and effortless while executing some of the most difficult (nearly gravity defying) movements the human body can perform. The STRENGTH that comes with this craft is not often talked about, but seriously, the muscle control one has to have to be a ballerina is other worldly to be. MAJOR RESPECT.

I wanted to design something that embodied the essence of a ballerina‚Ä¶cuz whether or not you‚Äôre on stage, don‚Äôt you wanna feel like the nexus of strength and grace in your everyday life? I do!!
