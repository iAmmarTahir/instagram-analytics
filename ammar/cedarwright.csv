People compare Paragliding to chess in the sky.¬† I think this analogy is faulty. I once¬†heard, ‚ÄúParagliding is like playing chess with dice that are a round.‚Äù ¬†Closer to the truth?¬†¬†I think chasing XC records is a little bit like fishing.¬†¬†You cast your line and hope you catch a big one.¬† Really, Paragliding is closer to poker than chess... a game of skill and chance. ¬† 

This winter in Roldanillo I played my cards and launched my line into some absolutely epic weather. I arrived with the pie in the sky goal of breaking the FAI record for what is probably the most popular winter paragliding destination in the world.¬† Success was unlikely, but I‚Äôve been working on my delusional self-belief.¬†

¬†On the 25th of January I realized an unlikely dream and put myself and the USA flag at the top of the Roldanillo x-contest score! I pushed, I believed, and I closed a 219 Km magical mystery tour of the Valle de Cauca.¬†¬†Elated and exhausted, I rested.¬† My glory was short-lived. The next day Bogdan Bialka took his record back pushing it to 230!¬† And‚Ä¶ the next day Kevin Phillip took to the sky with a vengeance setting a new record of 236 km‚Ä¶legend.¬† The Roldanillo¬†FAI record was beaten 3 days in a row!¬† I spent the next two weeks in an absurd version of paragliding Groundhog Day trying to reclaim the record.¬† On three separate occasions, the dream was within grasp but shut down by the unpredictable Pacifico winds and a pace that just wasn‚Äôt fast enough. It‚Äôs fair to say that this was a historic season for Paragliding in Roldanillo.¬† 

Of the top 50 scored flights on x-contest, 46 of them were from this year!¬†¬†It‚Äôs more the journey than the destination, and I‚Äôm grateful for the motivation that being a record chasing psychopath gave me.¬† Epic scenery, wild low saves, thousands of kms, and almost 200 hours of full-bar obsession on my Enzo and Sub.¬†While the Rolda. FAI record is more elusive than ever, I‚Äôm grateful that I got to be king for a day, and learned a ton about paragliding and the power of delusional self-belief.... ¬†which is why I‚Äôll be taking the record back next year.¬†

Next round of dirtbag fund applications opening soon! In Emilio‚Äôs words: ‚ÄúThis summer i got lucky enough to be one of the recipients of Cedar Wright‚Äôs dirtbag fund! this was the only time being a dirt bag paid in money as well as experiences. For a while now  I‚Äôve been going into the backcountry every summer‚Äîmountaineering, climbing, and eating homemade dehydrated eggs for weeks (sometimes months) at a time. Outside of that I‚Äôve been maximizing a dirtbag life by living in an RV in rural North Carolina, splitting my time between grad school and climbing, honing my trad skills and getting repeated tastes of humble pie at Moores Wall and Stone Mountain. This spring I used up the last of my cash to buy plane tickets to fly out to Washington and was ready to be completely broke until the dirtbag fund came to my rescue! Crisis averted: Thank you Cedar!! As soon as I arrived in Washington, my climbing partner Mo and I hit the road towards the Olympics, where we repeated Wayne Wallace‚Äôs ‚ÄúSawtooth Ridge.‚Äù Sawtooth was one of the best climbs I‚Äôve had the privilege of doing, with some cerebral and delicious leads. The choss got the best of us, though, and Mo and I both ended up in the hospital.. Mo for a shoulder injury and I for a rectal prolapse and sphincter incision after a fall. While we were able to walk ourselves out of the Olympics, these injuries kept us out of the pickets for the season. I used up more of the dirtbag funds to pay for the hospital bills, some salmon, and a ride back to NC. As I was healing in NC, I was climbing as much as possible and getting some exposure therapy. Eventually I was able to bum around and climb in West Virginia and was comforted by bulletproof rock... I drained the fund on gas money, and got to climb all over the Linville Gorge. 
Although my main objectives were put on pause because of the injury, the stoke for dirtbaggery is at an all time high!!!‚Äù",32,998,1699551526,,https://scontent-gru1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/399902486_1747763665649476_3729167863799758269_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15&_nc_ht=scontent-gru1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=haGAOiqydxQAX_DvxMl&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAEpT-KLrZFLvy1Uca67THfhOVre-46B_0xzz_gmLb48A&oe=65E74DCD&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
