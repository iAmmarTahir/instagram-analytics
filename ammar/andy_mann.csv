This album was tracked live in a small room, which is not the norm in for a studio session. (Either is actually building a pop-up studio in a cabin in the woods). 

There is an undeniable adventure in recording this way. You get what you get, mistakes and all. There lives a certain beauty, and honesty, in these songs because of it. Wear your scars. 

This is the final chorus to Full Moon Fight, the title track to the EP. I hope you enjoy it. I‚Äôve fought a lot in the dark. Big thanks to this band for helping bring it to the light. @eliandwest @mgonigle @forrestliketrees

The ocean‚Äôs impact rushes far beyond the sand, so when you support the sea, you send a ripple of hope throughout the world. This year, thanks to an anonymous donor, your gift to the ocean doubles with every donation matched! 

Every organism on Earth relies on the ocean‚Äì many as a home, but all for its services. To advocate for it, and defend its ability to carry out invaluable interactions, our team works with scientific experts, coastal communities, global leaders, and influential figures to generate waves of change. We and our partners know that our interconnected planet survives and thrives as one. So together, we help establish ocean solutions that compound with every ecological interaction. Just this year, our team:

- Helped expand and announce a Panamanian marine protected area that added 90,000 sq km (~35,000 sq mi) of protected waters in the Banco Volc√°n Area of Managed Resources.
- Shared the ocean‚Äôs impact and encouraged its protection to global audiences with co-founders @paulnicklen and @mitty‚Äôs feature on CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúCall to Earth‚Äù series.
- Completed a Rapid Assessment Visual Expedition (RAVE) in Chilean Patagonia, where we amplified the importance of maintaining the waters holding the largest continuous kelp forest in the world.
- Released new episodes of our ‚ÄúA Sea of Hope‚Äù series‚Äì capturing and uplifting the realities facing our ocean, while inspiring its protection. Our work was recognized by prestigious peers, and we accepted two finalist nominations at the @jacksonwildorg Media Awards!
- Took over the @UNbiodiversity Instagram to share the importance of the ocean and our unique approach to protecting it through the ‚ÄúRebuilding Life Roadmap.‚Äù
- Amplified the role of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands to our global community while urging protections that would maintain the Southern Ocean‚Äôs stability.

And so much more! Thanks to you and your donations, we can continue to shape a brighter future for our ocean and every individual who relies on it. Visit the link in our bio to support our work!

Foremost - My producer and longtime friend @eliandwest for helping me bring this to life with his trio of instantly talented musicians and giving me the confidence to record this album in a live setting. 

@mgonigle for his amazing fiddle playing throughout. What an honor - melody chasing magic!

@forrestliketrees for his tasteful bass work, keeping even the weirdest musical passages of ‚ÄúCalling Cousteau‚Äù on time. Vibe tech!

@swingfingers.recording for his education, patience and mentoring through this process and building us a studio in an old lodge on Mount Rainer from the ground up. 

@cahalen_morrison for helping me turn these ideas into thoughtful words and pushing me to chase more poetic ideas. Every song has his touch. 

@nickwdunbar for reigniting this musical journey for me over the years and lovingly molding this piece of hard clay into something somewhat supple enough to even be able to play with this band. 

@gregoryalanisakov for the years of inspo and friendship, lyrical guidance and helping me throughly through the mixing process.

@sealegacy @paulnicklen @mitty for always being my biggest support system and championing me to explore this project, through and through. . 

@jer.collins for the cover illustration and visualizing these songs into a genuine handmade piece of art.

Each day, as we work to amplify our ocean‚Äôs stories and restore its health, we do so with Paul‚Äôs reliable voice and commitment to change, helping to steer the ship. While not all have the opportunity to encounter Paul‚Äôs prowess for leadership firsthand, his unreplicable ability to capture and create resonant stories can be experienced much more broadly. Fearlessly exploring every corner of the world, he brings unreachable scenes vividly and candidly to our fingertips, opening the door to worlds that may otherwise go unseen. Paul engages us with charismatic creatures and their realities. His love for the ocean and its wildlife radiates through his work, and, with his artistic voice, proximity becomes negligible, and action is inspired. 

Share in the celebration, and help Paul and our team continue to bring our ocean‚Äôs stories to life by signing up for the Tide.
