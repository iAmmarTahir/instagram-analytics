42059454,argonautphoto,C1ifxc1JK7M,False,"Looking back at some of my favorite creative projects + collaborations from 2023! 
1: Always #1 are my projects with my family, from underwater photography in French Polynesia to rockhounding in Oregon or even just the macro photos in our front yard! 
2: I took the first steps into a 100+ year project, a soon to be mountain-top Artist in Residency within a larger Conservation mission, ranging many hundreds of acres on the edge of the Sespe with @devlin_gandy , having just acquired the property together a few weeks ago! (much, much more on this soon!)
3: Launched www.Firstfilm.xyz, a blockchain archive project with the help of Chikai Ohazama, a searchable archive of the entirety of my first body of work: every frame from start to finish, of my journey into Svaneti (1998-2000). This collection of 732 film strips documents the evolution of my photographic eye, and shows frame by frame my birth as a photographer. 
4: Launched “Wallpaper for the end of the world,” a collection of FREE wallpaper patterns (for physical walls or Zoom backdrops) made from my images of the climate crisis. Download them at crisiscurated.com updates at @crisiscurated
5: Collaboration with artist @killeracid to build AR activated currency for @amplifierart raising $35k in NFT sales to support our mental health initiatives in K-12 classrooms.
6: Creative directing with long time friend and collaborator @obeygiant to launch a new series of his works on Democracy, all a fundraising effort for an Amplifier 2024 photography Fellowship...
7: Launched AmplifierFellows.org a Fellowship to support photo-based artists working to safeguard Democratic Institutions in the US.
8: AR activated art and animations series for @insidenatgeo x Amplifier with some of my favorite artists in in the world (@osheen.siva , @_mazatli_, @toosphexy, @no_touching_ground, @tracieching, and @ernestoyerena!)
9: Work with @grandcanyontrust on a series to help educate about + protect the lifeways of the Little Colorado River with @devlin_gandy
10: And EVERY single project I was lucky enough to work on with the powerhouse @AmplifierArt team of @cleobarnett, @bellabelove, @emilygirasol , + @julietaeiou!

42059454,argonautphoto,C1FjE6SPwtN,False,"Deadline for applications extended to Dec 31! Three $20,000 fellowships will be awarded by @amplifierart to photographers and photo-based artists to work on projects addressing threats to democratic institutions in the US in the lead up to the 2024 election. We are looking for photographers to go beyond the minimum of wrapping up a quick photo essay for publication. Fellows will need to be open to collaboration and able to pivot to add layers throughout the year to address the dynamic landscape of 2024. This is an incredible opportunity to work with our advisors and partner orgs (and myself!) to make a real impact! 

“As threats to our democracy continue to evolve, so must we! In the spirit of that evolution, we are launching the Amplifier Democracy Fellowship! Link in header! Returning to our roots in photojournalism and community storytelling, we are merging our extensive networks in editorial journalism with insights from museum and art institution advisors, and building on a foundation of advising from leaders in nonprofits dedicated to safeguarding voting rights and other foundational elements of democracy. With the support of this incredible team, we are committing to working with at least 3 photographers and photo-based artists in 2024. Each fellow will be awarded $20,000 for the year. We aim to expand this fellowship with a kickstarter in February to launch additional rapid response grants and assignments throughout the year, showcasing work across new platforms, major media networks, and through our tried and true public interventions. 

Though nonpartisan, this project is not about simply bearing witness. Fellows will be expected to wield lenses and light, composition and concept, as tools of transformation. We are not here to merely observe democracy’s trials from the sidelines, but to engage deeply, to utilize our art to reinforce and protect the pillars of our democracy from decay and outright attack. There is no application fee! >>> www.amplifierfellows.org
