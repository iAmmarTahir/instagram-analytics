I’ve followed the work of plein air painters from this state before I ever picked up a camera. It’s been fun growing familiar with the language of the landscape first hand, to see the peaks and valleys that translated to such inspiration. 

Finding beauty can be straightforward, it shines unabashed, but exploring what you have to say about a place takes time. It may even be through the creative process itself that you discover it. I often learn as much during a week on the computer with a digital paintbrush, as a week on the trail. Wouldn’t trade the epiphanies provided by either.

I’ve been experimenting with the public domain images available on the NASA website. What you see here are constructed entirely from that source. It’s been strange, and wasn’t until I found the article referenced above that I realized why. The light on Mars is ‘weird’ because the atmosphere is different. Go figure.

As I worked, the project became as much about understanding this unique light as playing with Martin landforms. The images here explore a few ways to bridge a blue light source - with golden/orange scattering, across a few different angles and times of day in a variety of atmospheric dust. It’s definitely not accurate, and surely exaggerated. (Check out the article, lots of math above my ability) The science was simply a point of departure for experimentation. The main gist i held in mind, is that blue can transition through purple & red or green & yellow to get to orange. Just walk your way around a color wheel. Fun.

3463244,bejamin,CXWdk-OuVjE,False,"There’s a balance between surface and substance, the aesthetics of an image and its meaning. I tend to think craft is important, but offers diminishing returns. In contrast, the possibilities for conceptual exploration are endless. It’s the difference between learning a language and finding what you have to say with it.

My favorite time in art history was between the late 1800’s and the early 1900’s, when the method used to create something started gaining awareness of its contribution to content. An interest in the mechanics of light and sight created the dappled visual color mixing of the impressionists. An interest in the mechanics of time and space gave birth to the multiple overlaid perspectives of cubism. I keep thinking about this as I flew about the mountains, collecting images from multiple moments and perspective.

Does any of this matter to the viewer and the final? Maybe. There are plenty of images I’ve enjoyed for their ideas, and plenty for aesthetics alone. But on this side of the image, the one of discovery and creation, building something with a conceptual foundation makes all the difference between a meaningful process and a simply stylish one. It’s powerfully good to stay in touch with that little kid inside, who endlessly asks “why?!”

3463244,bejamin,CW1bm3eBo74,False,"One of my favorite fascinations is searching for repeated patterns in scale, micro and macro. Maybe it has to do with searching for something fundamental in the nature of things, or maybe it’s just fun to pretend you’re giant or very very small. 

This digital painting came together with shots from the mavic3 while climbing, and macro shots of rocks collected along the way.

Matching light and atmosphere is the most important factor to make a realistic scene, but texture is one of the biggest scale giveaways, so drones are the perfect tool to marry the two.

Then last month, DJI asked me to try out their Mavic3. Always happy to see through a different lens, I spent a couple weeks dodging fall storms in Idaho. (Really digging the extended battery life BTW.) Ironically, I’m now realizing my artistic process; harmonizing an eclectic array of images (somewhere around 30 here), isn’t so different than life process; harmonizing an eclectic array of interests. I really think the key is remembering to identify with the fascination, not the subject of it. Trust that single source of light, and the rest will sort itself in time, or Photoshop.

I don’t know any of these cats. Idris and Todd are making powerful work today, but James was born in 1834, so it might be a challenge for us to get together. But, that’s the cool thing about art. We can dialogue with anyone throughout time.

This one finds me curious about their feelings on substance vs style. Inspiration vs appropriation. The relationship between how we make something, and why. 

Idris created a seminal series that appropriated the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher, with (it appears) the intent of adding meaning. Todd’s style is highly copied by other contemporary photographers, who arguably don’t add additional meaning. And James was a big proponent of art for aesthetics alone - meaning be damned (and fought over in lawsuits.) Of course his stance was taken in an age when images were relatively rare and filled with allegory, which to him might have made this fight feel - quite meaningful. 🙃",341,36673,1616347649,"{'id': '285093439', 'has_public_page': True, 'name': 'Oregon', 'slug': 'oregon'}",https://instagram.fbkk24-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/162693240_265790508505001_4717501617135125780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.fbkk24-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=105&_nc_ohc=PsxV2c6muOMAX9M5-8r&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAcgVwAnq9WA56JHuZkMv7Ab61FbUmPE0Cow52x7XABHQ&oe=65EB1B33&_nc_sid=8b3546,True

Six Persimmons - The classic Chinese painting by the Buddhist monk Muqi. (An image that’s taken me years to understand).

Zen gardens and stones - They’re often used as a cliche representation for dreamy, sleepy relaxation, spa treatments and the like, when the reality of Zen practice can be quite serious and ardent effort towards waking up.
