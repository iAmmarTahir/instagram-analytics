It is literally EVERYTHING I did to lose 20lbs of fat pre/post-menopause. This program great for ANYONE, but especially great for women over the age of 40. 

I know it seems counter intuitive to think that LESS is MORE, but trust me! Your body will thank you! As we age we don’t have hormone levels to offset high cortisol levels.

Simply put, high intensity workouts raise your cortisol levels. Too much cortisol can = belly fat (as well as a lot of other possible health complications like high blood pressure, diabetes & heart disease). 

The best part of my MenoMagic program is the MenoMagic 37 page nutritional guide.📖 

I know no ones reads anymore,😉 but ladies, I wrote out EVERYTHING you need to know to feel and look your best in perimenopause and menopause!🪄

MenoMagic is included with a membership to my BYG Method platform (+ all my other programs and classes!)

Comment “MAGIC” and I’ll send you more info!

9614635,beachyogagirl,CxvXzCdrw2X,True,"It’s here!🪄My new MenoMagic 4-week Challenge is now available!✨

When I was 45, I went into full-blown menopause. It wasn’t long before I had gained 20 pounds of mostly visceral fat around my stomach.

Visceral fat is dangerous and leads to health complications and diseases so it isn’t something we should just “get used to” as many told me.😡

It took me awhile, but after 2 years of being consistent with resistance training, walking each day, and with a few changes to my nutrition, I was able to lose the weight.💪🏻

I have created MenoMagic for women in perimenopause or post-menopause. It is the exact plan that I did to shed fat and build muscle.

Trust me, I know what it’s like to workout hard (like you used to) and continue to gain weight. It can be so deflating.😣

Every woman is different but I want to give you hope that menopause weight gain is not something you just have to live with. 

The MenoMagic program comes with a FREE guide you can download to help you know how to make a few changes to the meals you already make!👩‍🍳

It is the “secret sauce” to this program!

If you are a BYG Member, head over to the programs page and check it out! 

If you are not yet a member, you can sign up for a 7-day trial with the link in my profile. 🔗

If you decide that it’s not for you, keep the guide as my gift! Cancel anytime before the 7 days and you won’t be charged!🙌🏻

9614635,beachyogagirl,Cu2RW0ktces,True,"Pre & post menopause has been a rollercoaster! I’m 49, and I’ve been navigating this ride for the past 9 years. (Peri menopause started at age 40🫠)

One thing I forgot to mention in this video is that SLOW weight loss is the BEST kind of weight loss! There is no rush. Be consistent even if it takes years because the slower it comes off the better for long term success.

It’s taken me over 2 (maybe more) years to lose the belly fat. Before I get comments about how I looked great before and didn’t need to lose the weight… here’s the deal:

Visceral fat is fat around your organs & can lead to many health complications. When I started gaining weight around my belly, it wasn’t subcutaneous fat that you could pinch. It was hard, and felt so uncomfortable.

I knew that I had to figure out why this was happening or rather what I could do to stop & reverse the weight gain.

I’ve written several blogs about my discoveries from diet to exercise & exactly the changes I made so please check them out for more info.

I get messages from women every day about weight gain, specifically belly fat, & I’m posting this content for them.

When our hormones decline, we are at much greater health risks like heart disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes.

I recommend talking to your doctor & getting a full blood work up. Vitamin, mineral, & fiber deficiencies can make menopause even worse so it’s always good to know how well (nutrient-wise) you are eating.

With exercise, resistance based workouts to help build muscle will help protect your bones and increase your metabolism.

Consistency is hard for a lot of people. My only advice is to not make it a choice. 

Just like brushing your teeth, doing your laundry, or cleaning your dishes, you do it because it just has to get done.🙌🏻

If you don’t know where to start, or how to “motivate” yourself, I create monthly challenges on my platform! EVERY DAY of the year is planned for you - all you have to do is push play!💪🏻

Please let me know if the comments if you like this content or want me to talk about anything else.🙏🏻

I was in a car accident at age 19 and ended up with 2 herniated discs and a sprained knee that caused YEARS of pain!

It wasn’t until 20 years later 😱 that I randomly found the art of hand balancing and was introduced to this awesome core & hip flexor strengthening drill.🙃

Not only did my handstand improve, but my quads became more toned, and my low back pain and knee pain disappeared!🙌🏻😁

Many years of stretching and not strengthening my hip flexors had lead to imbalances in my body.

These imbalances made my knees and back hurt from simple things like standing on my feet for more than 15 minutes at a time.

Does your back and knees hurt from standing?

Give these a try and let me know in the comments if you want me to post a beginner version!

9614635,beachyogagirl,C35xS7exdwi,True,"LESS IS MORE!🙌🏻

After menopause, high-intensity workouts only raised my cortisol levels, made me hungrier, sore, sometimes injured, and left me feeling depleted & drained for hours - sometimes days! 😐 Can you relate?

The combination of those things only made me gain more weight (fat), especially around my stomach. I was miserable trying to keep up with what I “thought” I should be doing.

When I slowed down & started doing less (less time, less intensity, less stress) my body said THANK YOU and I began losing fat.

I know it doesn’t seem like home workouts will work, especially with everyone on social media telling you that you need to kill yourself in the gym to see results, but they do!!

My BYG Challenges are the exact training program/schedule that I do to stay strong, flexible, & fit. 

I program every day of the year for you! All you have to do is show up and push play!

My March challenge starts FRIDAY!🌈🍀🙌🏻Low-impact, resistance-based Pilates, yoga, & strength training at-home workouts!

We are using the BIG stability ball as well as the small ball, dumbbells, and bands. Don’t worry if you don’t have the ball, I’ve programmed an optional class for you to do!🤗

You will leave your sessions with me feeling ENERGIZED & JOYFUL! 🤗

Tips:
1. Exhale with sound on contraction
2. While doing exercises where your back is on the floor, brace your core & flatten your back to the floor. Keep your back planted firmly as you lower legs.
3. To see results: Pair workouts with eating whole food.
Avoid refined sugar, excess saturated fat, and food that contain empty calories.
