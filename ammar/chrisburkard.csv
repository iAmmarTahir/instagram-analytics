36045182,chrisburkard,C38buG2yu9p,False,It‚Äôs wild to consider the amount of life these mountains have witnessed throughout different chapters in the history of the world... Hannibal leading the Carthaginian army across the alps in 218 BC to the development of alpinism and years of brave people ticking off first ascents with only rudimentary gear and a strong will. Every time I set foot in them.. it invites a way of life that encourages constant awareness without distraction. You have to pay attention to your surroundings but you also feel at peace with that rhythm of life - something I find harder to achieve surrounded by man made structures.
