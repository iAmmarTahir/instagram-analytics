I could tell you now how awesome and creative the Instagram community was in the first years. It was, indeed! 
‚†Ä
But the thing is ‚Äì even though so much has changed: I‚Äôm still burning for photography, enthusiastic to capture that special moment, to master the equipment, to learn new editing skills, to travel and explore. And many other people here on Instagram do as well ‚Äì and that is inspiring.

Let me share a story behind these #Berlin TV Tower photos: They were all taken with my old, affordable telephoto lens (Sony 70-300 G OSS). 

Later on, I upgraded to a high-end telephoto lens, but guess what? This year, I found my way back to the budget-friendly one! Why? It‚Äôs smaller and more lightweight, I handle it with less caution and ultimately it helped me to capture moments like these better.

Speaking of photography gear, did you know you can buy and sell equipment hassle-free at @MPBcom? Not only does it make photography more affordable, but it‚Äôs also a sustainable choice. I sold my high-end lens and bought myself a Fujifilm x100v (new photos coming soon). üì¶‚ú®

And here‚Äôs the cherry on top: MPB is proudly sponsoring the German Street Photography Festival at PHOTOPIA Hamburg. As part of the celebration, you have a chance to win a Fujifilm X100V camera. üéâ

Here are some of my favorite street photography moments from different corners of the world.

These shots may vary in location and theme, but they all have one thing in common: they were captured using a telephoto lens, my favorite setup for street photography. 

Why, you ask? Because it allows me to observe life from a distance and flatten the depth of a photo, bringing clarity and crispness to the scene.

Speaking of street photography, something exciting is on the horizon: @mpbcom proudly sponsors the German Street Photography Festival at @photopia_ham in Hamburg (September 21st - 24th), and we're giving away tickets.

üé∞ How can you win two tickets? Leave a comment under this post and follow @mpbcom.

We're also curious to know if you have a favorite lens for street photography, but that's optional. Good luck! üçÄ
