Some of the exercises we did together, and some I did a more advanced option…so, no matter what level your training partner is, you can get those gains together! 🙌🏼

2 ROUNDS

▪️1. BACK SQUAT
x10

▪️2. ‘W’ ROW
x20

▪️3. SLIDING LUNGES
*or SPLIT SQUATS
x10

▪️4. GORILLA ROW
x10 each side

▪️5. STEP UP
*or HIGH STEP LOWERS
x10

▪️6. SKI ERG
*we aimed for max Cal’s in 1min

▪️7. What we do on our drink breaks 😂

For those of you who haven’t met mum before, she has never really been into fitness or sport her whole life. She grew up in rural Poland and sport and fitness wasn’t really a thing for girls or women. Fast forward to her at 73. I brought her to the gym for a session, she did the whole workout with a smile on her face, no excuses, an open mind, and willingness to try anything (no matter what I throw at her!) 😃 She’s been coming every week, for 3 years. She is my inspiration and I am so proud of her! 🥰

✨ IT’S NEVER TO LATE ✨

302091686,amandabisk,C3ryicSPelD,False,"HANDSTANDS FOR BEGINNERS 🤸🏽 these can be a tricky (and sometimes scary 😵‍💫) skill to learn…so here are some beginner exercises you can try to help you build:

✅ Confidence upside down
✅ Body awareness when things get flipped upside-down
✅ Good handstand body position
✅ Strength in your shoulders, core & hands

🐌 Start sloooowwww 🐌 
▪️The first time you try, just spend 5minutes having a play. You can do this everyday but have a rest day if you start to feel any pain in your wrists (❗️Remember your wrists & shoulders need to build strength in this new position…this takes time!)
▪️Increase the time you spend on your hands slowly each week. Maybe add a minute or 2 to each session. (Add that rest day when needed!)

✨Key tips✨
▪️Try to build a straight line from your hands to shoulders to hips (in both exercises). A training buddy can help you find this position if you can’t feel it!
▪️Fingertips spread wide & pressing down into the ground
▪️Shoulders squeezing ears & push the ground A W A Y

There are a MILLION more tips that I can share so it’s important to remember handstands are a skill and they are complex! So it’s ok if you don’t get it straight away ☺️ Take it slow and have fun!

Also…I’m super keen to run handstands workshops! First stop will be Perth 📍 Who’s keen?! #hanstandtips #beginnerhandstand #handstand

302091686,amandabisk,C3jxqyovnLC,False,"MOBILITY FOR TIGHT HIPS 💫 These are some of my favourite hip releases 👌🏼 Perfect to do as part of your warm up, before a run, on a recovery day or when you are feeling a bit sore/tired from training… I sometimes get lower back tightness and these also help release tension & pain! ☺️

▪️1. LOW SQUAT
- lower your hips to any position that is manageable and where you can keep your heels on the ground & elbows inside the knees (Level 1,2 & 3 shown in order in the video ☺️)
- if you can reach level 3, aim to pull your belly & chest forward at the bottom, spreading the knees wide.
AREAS RELEASED - Groin, hamstrings, low back

▪️2. LOW LUNGE RAINBOW DIVE
- as you reach back open your chest as much as possible & sink the hips.
- guide the elbow toward the ground reaching as low as you can.
AREAS RELEASED - Groin, hip flexor, glute, hamstring, low back

▪️3. GLUTE SLIDE
- foot rests close to the opposite hand as knee slides through the arms as far as you can.
- for a deeper release, slide the back knee further back into a longer lunge.
AREAS RELEASED - Glutes, hip flexor, hamstrings, low back

How do you think you’ll incorporate these movements into your day? ☺️ let me know! 👇🏼 #hiprelease #hipmobility #hipflexibility #lowbackpain #glutepain #hippain

302091686,amandabisk,C3XbIIsPSxS,True,"MORE GLUTES IN YOUR DEADLIFT 🍑 OR MORE HAMSTRINGS 🍖 Here’s how you get your aim right…

GLUTE FOCUSED DEADLIFT 🍑
This requires more STRETCH of the glute muscle to occur because more stretch = increased tension = more activation & work required to contract the muscles again. And more work = MORE GROWTH!
👉🏼 so what do you need to do? 
Increase the amount of knee bend and lower the hips more. This creates a deeper fold at the hips (and also less tension in the hamstring) increasing the recruitment of the glutes 👌🏼

HAMSTRING FOCUSED DEADLIFT 🍖
The same principle applies. You need to create more stretch & length in the hamstrings compared to the glutes.
👉🏼 so what do you need to do?
Less bend in the knees (bust still a slight bend 😉) and keep the hips higher as you lower the bar. 

🎥 WATCH MY FULL YT VIDEO FOR A DETAILED & VISUAL EXPLANATION ☺️ (link in stories)

It’s important to note that both muscle groups will be active in a deadlift, no matter which variation you do. This technique tip helps you shift more or less tension into each muscle group depending on what your training goals are 😎 Hope this helps!

Building strength in the glutes, stability in the hips & maintaining active feet is so important for efficient & injury free leg driven km’s (or miles!) 🏃🏽‍♀️💨

I’ve sped these videos up a little bit so remember to do each exercise slowly and with purpose!

TRY BEFORE RUNNING:
1-3 rounds depending how much time you have (the more often you do these, the better results you will get 💪🏼)

▪️1. CLAM SEQUENCE
x10 each side

- do all 3 exercises in a row, making sure you don’t collapse in the bottom ribcage between each exercise.
- keep the hips still (like there are in concrete) 

💥WORKS: Glute med & min - important for good lower body gait & hip stability

▪️ 2. SL TUCK CIRCLES
x10 each side

- keep belly button pulled in as you hold hips high & aim to keep hips still.

💥WORKS: Glute max, med & min / hip flexors / abs - helps build hip stability during leg movement

▪️3. SL EXTENDED RDL
x10 each side

- standing leg always has a slight bend
- fold at the hips & keep spine long (sit into standing leg a bit deeper)

💥WORKS: Glute max, med & min, quads, hip flexor - improves balance, hip stability & foot strength

▪️4. HIP HIKES
x10 each side

- move slowly & through full range on every rep (full up - full down)

💥WORKS: Glute med & min / obliques - improves hip stability & lower body gait

▪️5. FOOT SEQUENCE
x10 each side

Heel-Toe
- as you lean back pick up all 10 toes. Spread them as wide as you can as you roll foot forward then rise to toes.

Outdide-Inside
- slight bend in the knees & aim to find edges of your feet while spreading toes.

💥WORKS: Calves / Smaller foot muscles - important for good foot biomechanics and strength (our feet become weak as we are constantly in shoes!)

302091686,amandabisk,C2wZVHoPERF,True,"WALL ANGELS 👼🏼 These were an absolute game changer for my shoulder pain. No joke.

Mid last year I started getting shoulder pain in the back of my shoulder blade that really affected my arm movements over head (including handstands! ) 😩 My favourite! I battled with it for months and tried lots of different rehab exercises but THIS ONE was what changed everything for me.

I started doing 10 slow reps throughout the day. I made a rule: every time I passed the same wall in my house, I would do 10 reps. Or when I was waiting for food to cook in the kitchen etc. It maybe ended up being 4-6 times in the day (so ~50 reps every day). 

It didn’t really affect the flow of my day too much BUT it completely eradicated my shoulder pain! 😱 Not to mention, my ‘winging’ shoulder blades that I have battled with all my life, are slowly finding a better position sitting FLAT onto my back (at last!!! 🥺🥰)

👉🏼 I CAN NOT RECOMMEND THESE ENOUGH. 👈🏼

Especially if you suffer from any upper thoracic pain, neck pain, back pain, poor shoulder movement, or struggle with bad posture.

⏰ As always, daily consistency will get you the best and quickest results. I still do these, but they are now a quick part of my warm up before any workout. It maybe takes 2 min to do 3 slow sets 👊🏼

Try it and let me know how you go! 👇🏼

Do you already do these?!
