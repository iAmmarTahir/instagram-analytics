It‚Äôs easy to judge a book by its cover. After all, you don‚Äôt need to read it to do so. But what if, by doing so, you‚Äôre preventing yourself from reading a book that could change the trajectory of your life?

The same is true for your daily actions, choices, thoughts, and behaviors. We live on autopilot and quickly dismiss anything that is alien to us, rushing back to the too-comfortable familiar self.

But what is hiding behind the surface?

The evolved version of you.

We have been Sapiens for a very - very - long time, and now, with the advancements in science and the convergence of exponential technology, we are on the verge of societal quantum leaps that will redefine our existence. 

We can, literally, evolve from our Sapiens nature.

But this abundant future is not inevitable. There are still so many challenges and injustices we need to solve.

We, entrepreneurs, are the true driving force of change, and it's up to us to create that future of abundance. As each of us reaches our moonshot goals, slowly but surely, that future will become a reality.

What if we could, somehow, reach that future faster?

I do think it's possible. The key is tapping into your hidden potential. üîì

That potential can be hidden by a variety of factors: from thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, and habits, to an unoptimized physiology, just to mention a few. 

We could blame external factors - society, economics, dogma, etc. - but in the end, it's up to each of us. 

Every day, we get to decide who we want to be. And the powerful thing is, we can change!

That's why the key to evolution starts from within us. If you continuously optimize your physiology, mindset, and behavior, you can literally transform your life. 

And by investing this newly found potential into your mission, you will literally reach the future faster, discover a new level of fulfillment, all while contributing to creating a more equitable world for future generations. üå±

If you're curious about discovering your hidden potential, I'm just a DM away or simply email me at alessandro@beyondsapiens.co ‚ú®

I have achieved some, got close to others, and completely missed some.

And that‚Äôs completely fine. After all, it‚Äôs not about reaching goals but who you have to become to reach them. üå±‚ú®

For example:
üßä I wanted to take a 5-minute cold shower daily but missed 15 days during the year. 
üìö I wanted to read 100 books but ended up reading 76.
üìΩ I wanted to reach 378K YouTube views with Beyond Sapiens, but we ended up with 339,161.

What matters is to actually set goals for yourself, your mind, body, and work, not because of vanity metrics but so that you wake up with a great sense of purpose every single day of the year.

The last 12 months have been filled with incredible growth, learning, and discovery. There was also a lot of emotional pain and failures, which, as much as unpleasant, is needed to grow into a new, evolved version of yourself.

Starting and growing a business is one of the most brutal things you can do, but also one of the most fulfilling ones. And as 2024 approaches, I look forward to continuing the journey of positive impact with @beyond__sapiens which will soon bring me to the üá¶üá™‚ú®.

That's one of the many things that we rarely stop to think about. After all, we feel fine, so we think everything is fine until it's not.

It turns out, in fact, that only a few of us have great metabolic health. For example, a 2022 study from @tuftsuniversity found that only 6.8% of American adults had good cardiometabolic health.

If you want to optimize for longevity, metabolic health is something that you should master, so here's a carousel for you to get started!ü§ì

P.S. During these weeks, I've tested my metabolic health through @veri 's CGM and @lumen.me Lumen marked my metabolism as ""highly flexible"", while Veri calculated that I'm adding +4 years to my lifespan. That is not because of genetics or luck. In fact, until some years ago, I was overweight and metabolically stuck. So, no matter where you're at, you can improve.

üî• Chronic high blood sugar acts like a continuous false alarm, leading to chronic inflammation.

üîÑ High sugar levels produce more free radicals, causing oxidative stress. Remember, these are like rust that erodes metal over time.

‚ö° Overcharged cells from excess glucose wear out our cellular ‚Äùpowerhouses,‚Äù the mitochondria.

The result? A higher risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and even some cancers.
