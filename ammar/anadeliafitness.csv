24088189,anadeliafitness,CvsmwOipqYP,True,"📌Why is joint mobility important? (Read bellow⬇️) Video is speed up 3x for reels let me know in the comments if you prefer this format or would like to see normal speed as a carrousel format.🎥 
 
The way I see it, “Mobility” Is kind of like a collaboration effort between our muscles and joints.
 
When our joint mobility is limited, we might be missing out on opportunities to be stronger, more athletic, and more efficient.
 
The ability to move our joints through their full range helps our muscles work more optimally, and when our muscles can do their work, they can also get stronger and help keep our joints healthy in return.
 
💪🏼Having a good balance between strength and joint mobility helps distribute the stress more evenly through the body instead of overstressing our joints (back, hips, knees, ankles, etc.).
 
🚪Our joints are kind of like the hinges to a door; if that door remains unopened for long periods in addition to environmental decay, the hinges in that door will start creaking and get rusty overtime. In our case, it will be arthritis, bursitis, inflammation, and things like that.
 
So you see, just as with the door example, maintenance and movement were keys to extending the life and function of it, in our case, MAINTENANCE and MOVEMENT are also keys to a BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.🙌🏼

STAY ACTIVE!💪🏼

24088189,anadeliafitness,CvdMkLSJDiG,True,"Some days there is no plan. I just wanted to move a little so I did and it ended up being a light weight mobility exploration day.

Energy levels where on the low with some #Adenomyosis aches and pains in the mix. I wasn’t looking to exhaust myself in a long workout and risk feeling super tired afterwards. So I just moved for a bit, worked on some areas that I wanted to target and moved on with the rest of my day.

At the end I was feeling accomplished and still had energy to do other things the rest of the day. 

The are days I push and days I back down, IS MY BALANCE. As long as I am making positive progress is a win for me. I just try my best to be consistent with it.

Don’t compare your journey with anyone else’s.
