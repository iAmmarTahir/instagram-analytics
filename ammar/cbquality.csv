It‚Äôs no secret I‚Äôm always on the go ‚Äì whether traveling, working, or living life fully. It‚Äôs felt so great to move around freely, but we can‚Äôt forget that COVID is still here and it‚Äôs important to get updated vaccination as time passes. Helping to take care of myself includes staying up to date on vaccines to help protect myself (and I encourage my loved ones to do the same). Updated vaccination helps me feel more comfortable seeing people I love. This winter I‚Äôm choosing the Spikevax by Moderna vaccine as part of my seasonal vaccine routine.
