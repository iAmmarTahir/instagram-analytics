1988768,alexstrohl,CkHeB-Vp_KS,False,"Hello,

If you don’t know who I am, allow me to introduce myself. I’m Alex, I’m French but I grew up in Madrid, and I’ve been creating with a camera since 2009. “Professionally” since 2012. 

What gets me out of bed every morning is the deep desire to connect with people and environments. Meeting people and seeing places for the first time is a bit of an addiction.

I make photographs for brands when they hire me. I also make films for them too. I’m known for shooting landscapes and outdoors sports like cycling and hiking. I’ve also built a few companies such as @stayandwander (creative agency) and @wildistco (online photography school). I take pride in sharing what I know about the world of photography and have spent the last five years doing that both online and offline on photography retreats. 

Becoming a photographer happened by accident. As soon as I moved from France to Quebec to finish my design studies I got totally drawn in by the boreal forest and the harsh winters. It was, and still is an endless source of inspiration and peace. 

I struggle with scheduling because I am interested in a lot of things. I also struggle to make the time to go shoot more outside. Also, I’m a pretty bad handyman. 

I know it is very timely to hate on this app and what it is becoming. Although I agree with a lot of it, I’m also immensely thankful for this app that has allowed me to meet thousands of people. Some of which have become friends for life. It has also changed my life by helping create a career path for me and drawing sizeable exposure to my work. That I’ll never forget. 

With that said, It’s up to us to make IG what we want it to be… So here are my commitments to you: 

1. To always tell you like it is
2. To share work I’m proud of
3. To help you if you’re trying to help yourself..
