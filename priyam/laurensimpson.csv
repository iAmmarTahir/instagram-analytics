🎀Have I thought about birth plan? Im not set on anything because I want to educate myself further on it all. It’s still a whole new world to me. I’ll keep my plans to myself though as I don’t want the external noise/opinions. I’m a go with the flow kinda person so I won’t be having a rigid plan. I will do whatever is best for me and Bub at that time. 🫶🏼

🎀 Any food aversions? Hmm not really! But I do struggle now with feeling like eating salads & vege 😂 which is weird coz I lived off that before! Bread over salad any day right now 😂 I also am more sensitive to spicy foods 🥵

🎀What cream/oil am I using on my belly? Not sponsored or anything but I’ve been using Bangin Bod, Palmers and I also just bought an oil from ‘Willow by the sea’.

🎀How am I coping with my body changing? It’s the most comfortable & confident I’ve felt within myself. I feel at peace. It’s removed all the pressure off me to look a certain way…I’m just in awe of the female body and submerging myself fully in this new chapter!

🎀Baby shower? Yes…need to start planning!

🎀Do we like common or unique names? I’d say the name that’s top of my list is a little unique.

🎀When did you start to feel more pregnant? These last couple weeks my belly has popped a little! I notice it a lot more when I’m training…things can feel a bit more uncomfortable so I modify when I can. Eg I’m finding my stances on exercises becoming wider…eg squats & deadlifts.

✨Always love answering your questions & sharing this new chapter with you all! Thank you for all your daily love & support.🥹✨

Who else has avoided pasta over the years because they thought it would instantly make them gain weight??!!! 🙋🏼‍♀️🙈🙈

Pasta definitely gets demonised! 😅

Yes some can be super calorie dense…however here is a delicious recipe you can make without blowing over your calorie budget! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼

What you need: (serves 2)
300g chicken breast
2 rashers of bacon (I used turkey bacon)
Italian seasoning
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Salt 
Pepper 
20g grated parmesan 
120g dry linguine (or pasta of your choice)
100ml chicken stock 
100ml low fat fat cream
Parsley finely chopped

🍝Method:

Season your chicken with garlic, onion, salt/pepper & Italian seasoning! Pan fry until cooked.

Cook pasta in boiling water

Cook bacon & cut into small pieces

To make the creamy sauce - add cream & chicken stock + same seasonings used with the chicken. Bring to the boil for approx 5 min!

Add your cheese & stir through. Heat for another 3-5 min.

Add your pasta and stir through.

Serve pasta topped with chicken, bacon & parsley!

ENJOY!!!! ♥️

8273287,laurensimpson,C37MOLwpiXf,True,"Get ready with me for the gym on a day I really couldn’t be fkd going! 

Who else has those slow super unmotivated mornings???? 🙋🏼‍♀️

Motivation doesn’t last forever. It comes and goes. It’s a normal part of the process. Its what gets you started...but what keeps it going?

I get asked all the time how am I so motivated 24/7? The answer is I’m not.😅

There are plenty of times I don’t want to train…I sit in the car at the gym procrastinating, or go to the gym do an exercise or two & just leave. I also sit at home telling myself so many excuses as to why it’s a whole lot ‘easier’ to just stay there and skip the gym.

However…the more I have continued on my journey I have realised that you can’t rely on motivation to keep you going. It’s much deeper than that. It comes down to DISCIPLINE.

Discipline is what keeps you going. Self discipline is the ability to do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.

✨Discipline > Motivation✨

The key to still being able to successfully move toward your goals…is to SHOW UP for yourself…even on the days you don’t feel like it. You get it done.

Yes your first squats and deadlifts may be bad

Yes you may feel a little awkward and uncomfortable trying something new for the first time

Your first attempt at anything in life is likely to be bad!

Remember, you grow through what you go through.

Everyone starts as a beginner!! We are all still figuring things out in life. We are all at different stages and chapters.

8273287,laurensimpson,C3vnDI5S5Hs,True,"20 weeks 🤰🏼half wayyyyy! My weekly ‘pregnant diaries’ update
 
This week we found out we were having a baby girl! I couldn’t be more excited. I also had my 20 week morphology scan and everything went well.

🥑Food: 
My focus is on 80% whole foods 20% soul foods. My days of eating are always different which is a real shift from the way I used to eat which was pretty ‘bodybuilder’. I don’t track my calories but am still somewhat mindful of my intake & getting in enough protein & a diverse range of micronutrients.

Cravings: CARBS! Still loving hot cross buns, anything bread + avo, fresh fruits…and I’ve definitely developed more of a sweet tooth than ever before.

🏋🏼‍♀️Training:
This week I’ve felt more ‘pregnant’ at the gym. I noticed exercises like RDLs becoming a little more uncomfortable as bump grows! I prefer a wider stance now so really like a sumo BB deadlift. I got in 3 session this week (was travelling so a bit out of routine).

😴Feeling?
Actually pretty good! Not as tired this week but maybe that’s because I am resting a little more. Most of the time I don’t feel pregnant because I do feel like my normal self!

Guys…it’s literally still the most surreal feeling to know there is a little human growing inside me right now haha. 

✨Think that’s about it! Any q’s let me know! Love connecting with you all on this new journey & hearing your stories too. Thank you all for the support 🥹🥹✨

8273287,laurensimpson,C3r1cDXJJmO,False,"Day of eats 🍽️

A most requested post…a look at what I’m eating right now (20 weeks pregnant).

To be honest my days differ almost every day. Some days I’m ravenous…some days I’m not. Some days I crave just fresh fruit, salads & veg…other days I couldn’t think of anything worse haha. (Can my fellow mummas relate??!! 😅) 

I’m not tracking my calories, but am somewhat mindful and am trying to get in sufficient protein + a diverse range of micronutrients. 

I used to be such a structured eater and have basically the same meals all week but now I’m really loving changing my meals up very often.

🥣Breakfast:
Oats, granola, protein powder, PB, strawberry & banana

🥑Lunch:
“Breakfast plate”. CRAVING is real for this. Eggs, sourdough with avocado, turkey bacon, grilled veggies

🍕Dinner: 
Tandoori chicken pizza
(Should I add this to the @laurensimpsonfitness app??)

🍉Snacks: 
Boost juice, PB bagels, fresh fruit (loving grapes, pineapple & watermelon), hot cross buns, muesli bars
