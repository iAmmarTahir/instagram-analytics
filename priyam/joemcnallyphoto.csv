Memories of a wonderful assignment for Nikon Latam, working in the urban areas of Lima and the Paracas Peninsula, which is sparse, forbidding and beautiful. Grateful to have worked with three incredibly talented women (@claudiamariaca, @lafefacox, @fvilogron) in front of the camera. Just ran a pic of Claudia and there were wonderful reactions and lots of questions. The whole series I worked quite simply, most of the time. A lot of one-light pictures. @profoto light shapers and sources, mostly B1X. At 500 watt seconds, I occasionally put two of those units into the same light shaper, to fight back against the harsh desert light. Beauty dishes, umbrellas, large soft boxes, we pretty much used it all, including grip and 12x12 silks provided by the peerless production company, @lacasa_films. So much fun to work with that talented team! Closing night I still remember Rafi‚Äôs homemade pizza üòä LaCasa Films, Claudia, Fefa and Francesca made the job easy at camera with their professionalism, energy and enthusiasm.

We‚Äôve worked together a couple of times, in Peru and in Vegas. Always amazing in front of the lens. Nikon D810 with a 70-200mm lens, from a fashion project a few years ago. The beauty and benefit of one big light source! @profoto B1-X through a 4‚Äô RFI Octa, fitted with a fabric grid. The grid helps keep light splash off the road in the foreground of the picture, which is always a dead bang giveaway as to where you put the light. Big light even from a distance is wonderful. Telephoto gives the endless road compression and a shape. And Claudia conveys to the scene a casual, nonchalant elegance.

Our group had the benefit and wonder of staying at LaSelva Lodge, a jewel of an ecolodge nestled in the heart of the jungle. Perched on a lagoon, the wild nature of the jungle is literally at your doorstep every day. Beautiful rooms, wonderful food, and an array of incredibly knowledgeable guides who lead you through a week of discovery with certainty and expertise. A terrific week. Thanks to all in our group, hardy travelers all, who made lovely images. The pic of this squirrel monkey was made with the @nikonusa Z 9 with the 180-600 f/6.3, ISO 6400 at the edge of dusk, hand-held from a canoe. Shutter speed was at 1/640th.  The new construction of Nikon‚Äôs long glass tremendously aids in hand holding, especially from an unstable platform.

All done with @nikonusa SB-5000 Speedlights. This set at the Blue Bar was just the beginning of the story of this lady of mystery.

198413731,joemcnallyphoto,C2fuIdWPfq8,True,"Shooting for Sports Illustrated was an adventure. Working, improbably, for the biggest, best, most powerful sports mag in the world. I say improbable as I was never much of a sideline, action-style photog. How could I be? At any major sports event, Sports Illustrated could populate any competition pitch in the world with photogs who need no explanation or introduction. Zimmerman, Leifer, Cooke, Drake, Iooss, Kluetmeier, Frakes, Iacono, Tiedemann, Biever, Millan - to name a few! Photogs with smarts, experience, knowledge of the game being covered, and an almost preternatural ability to be in the right place, with the right lens, at the critical moments of a contest. 
I was asked to become a contract photographer for SI in 1985. I was a feature guy, shooting the off-the-field stuff, the portraits, the concept-driven, illustrative spread type of photos that might lead a section or a major story. It was heady stuff, as SI had money to burn and the kind of powerful sway that would make even the most obnoxious sports agent return your calls. 
It was a great magazine, filled with writing that was often beautifully reflective and evocative, and the kind of still photos that made readers still want to pick up the magazine and devour visuals about a game that they had already seen. Can you imagine? It was like a Ron Howard movie every week, making a riveting story out of a game where everybody already knew who won. The power of good stories, in words and pictures, flowed from its pages.

One of the most amazing, talented and supremely fit people I ever photographed was Gabby Reece. Pro volleyball player of legendary status, fitness coach, model, author, podcaster. Shot this back in film days, medium format. The notion of strength I tried to conjure by having a huge prop volleyball made and to have her support it, Atlas-like. We got the ball to the desert and inflated it, and it was way too shiny and new. So the crew pretty much chipped in a bunch of our water to make a mud puddle on the parched turf and we then rolled the ball around in it. Location improv! Another significant improvisation was to take two hi-rollers off to the side and run hi strength monofilament fishing line to little loops that had been built into the prop ball. Barely visible even in the original negatives. Never published this frame before, always went with the color, but the B&W I think actually accentuates Gabby‚Äôs strength. LMK what you think. Highly recommend her podcast BTW. Also, she is married to monster wave surfer Laird Hamilton who is legendary himself. Together they are a font of fitness and excellence wisdom.
