116480,kirstenalana,Bb-2zYOlZ5U,False,"It’s funny how @Instagram has changed travel. When I visited Scotland for the very first time, this app was still new. The phenomenon of places becoming “instafamous” wasn’t even the seed of a thought in anyone’s mind yet. That first trip was for the purposes of enjoying Hogmanay in Edinburgh and so my experience was concentrated in or around the Royal Mile, Princes Street, the Gardens and Edinburgh Castle. Fast forward more than half a decade and you surely know how Instagram is now. So when @dante.vincent & I visited Scotland in October for vacation, we’d seen photos of this spot, Dean Village, more times than I can count. Though I’d never been, I felt as if I knew it yet since I didn’t, I was curious to check it out. I wondered if it was in fact as cool as everyone was claiming or if it was just simply as cool as all of Edinburgh is. For a city that’s not too large, it’s a true gem that hasn’t ever let me down. Dean Village was once just that, its own village, separate from the city. Now it’s absorbed into Edinburgh in terms of proximity though I’m not sure how it is legally. Mere minutes from the Castle and the Palace, it feels hours away. No longer a secret as the selfie sticks attested to. But still bucolic. Tranquil. It’s a place where the Water of Leith is heard echoing off ages old stone and flower boxes drip with vibrant blooms even in autumn. If you’re so inclined, you can even pick up the trail that follows the water for a total of 18 miles here in the village. Though sadly, Danté and I didn’t have time. As we walked up the hill back to our car, I wondered what part of the city might be “instafamous” by the next time we visit. And I wondered how the residents of this formerly quiet area feel about their newfound fame... 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 #ScotSpirit #LoveScotland #VisitScotland #HiddenScotland #thisisedinburgh #edinphoto #sonya7rii #sonyalpha",195,4694,1511750140,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/23967538_416746835435090_265523377978998784_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=102&_nc_ohc=3bVeDQgFrUcAX8MSYoj&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD5cd6b_Vzi-fnRIeqMu26foXZ4m1AsanPp1DMZWrzzaw&oe=65E7EE64&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
116480,kirstenalana,BuoTtE7h-Gu,False,"As I departed LAX to fly to Québec this week, there was a moment where I had the most profound sense of gratefulness for the fact that I can live in California. A state that is home to this spot off Highway 1, one of the most beautiful scenic drives in the United States. One of my favorite drives anywhere in the world in fact, even though I’ve been to more than 50 countries. The longer @dante.vincent & I live in California, the more grateful I find myself becoming.

Yesterday, Chris Burkard shared a post where he said, “It feels like the more we talk the less the words mean. I, for one, look forward to the silence the outdoors can bring...”

I‘m pretty sure he wasn’t talking about the Highway when he wrote that caption but I instantly thought of it. It’s the driving equivalent of a hike into back country. There’s so little development along large portions of the drive, save the road itself, that you can forget the stress of life in a city and feel so much closer to nature without needing the kind of outdoor experience that I think prohibits a lot of people from being out in nature more. Or even just caring about the planet period.

The noise of the car itself fades away on a drive like this and you hear instead the sound of waves, of birds, of the wind that you can’t see but you sure can feel. Even the sunshine feels like it has a quiet melody. It’s drives like this that helped me think about the planet as a place I wanted to save, not just experience.

116480,kirstenalana,C0PBhjRLK-i,False,"🇭🇷 After Chioggia and Koper, we sailed to Zadar during our hosted itinerary with @vikingcruises last month. 

From there we drove inland for a day trip @dante.vincent had chosen because it included a bird sanctuary and rehabilitation center with the possibility to try our hand at falconry. That didn’t end up happening. 

But we still got to see birds, we heard a very entertaining lecture, and we were able to spend time in Krka National Park. 

I was surprised by how green it still was for October, and the fact they have multiple blooming periods each year for the small purple cyclamen that can carpet the ground in parts of the park! If it’s your first time ever in Croatia, I’d recommend opting for the included walking tour of the Old Town of Zadar. It’s so charming and was one of my favorite stops during my last visit to Croatia many years ago now.

116480,kirstenalana,CzGrRwsxmlj,False,"Do you recognize this island?

It’s probably the most recognizable Slovenian landmark and yet from my friends who love the country, I know it’s far from the only thing to enjoy in 🇸🇮 

Still with my one afternoon ashore in the country as part of our hosted @vikingcruises, I wanted to visit understand why it’s so famous! 🤔

It was a 2 hour bus ride from the port of Koper and after arriving we took traditional Pletna boats to the island in the alpine lake that doesn’t allow motored craft and was once home to a temple to Ziva [the Slavic goddess of love and fertility] ❤️

I fell hard for these gleaming wooden boats with awnings that are compared to Venetian gondolas, passed down through the families that captain them. They’re controlled using two long wooden poles and to do so is to be called a Pletnarstvo.

On the island: visit the Church of  the Assumption whose current Baroque design dates to the 17th century with a chapel from the year 1004. Ring the bell from the 1500s to make your wish come true. Then climb the tower for views across the tiled roof to Bled Castle.

Before departing, get gelato at Café Potičnica. You’ll earn it once you’ve climbed the 99 steps from the boat launch and walked all the way up the 52-meter high tower!

So what makes it all so special that it’s one of the most photographed spots in the world? I still don’t know. 😂 But it is a charming area! 🥰 And the lake is so beautiful when the sun is shining and that alpine water gleams turquoise and green. Plus the excursion did make me want to return to see much more of Slovenia! If you’ve been, where else do you think people should visit in the country?

Literally thousands of people have seen their last sunset or awoken to their last sunrise — or lost loved ones — while I have continued to exist in safety and comfort.

I fear that no matter what I publish, it will be inadequate or will be misconstrued. Words used or unused are an imperfect construct in a time like this.

Yet I know they are needed. We have learned before that our silence is but one puzzle piece which ultimately enables atrocities to continue. 

@lindseytramuta wrote, “To want Jewish people to be safe wherever they are and for Palestinian people to be safe and free feels, more often than not, like wanting the impossible. This should not and cannot be the case. But it won’t happen with the unspeakably violent ideologies of a terror organization and a nationalist government, with the wholesale dehumanization of Israeli, Jewish, and Palestinian people, and a total lack of compassion. It won’t happen with war crimes and revenge disguised as defense—not when so many civilians pay the ultimate price.”

That has stayed with me. For every bone and sinew in my body desires life in a world where Jewish people and Palestinian people are safe and free. Where not one more child or innocent dies. 

I do not support genocide. I do not think that any Jewish person, anywhere, should suffer or die for the actions of those who make the choice to send the missiles and disperse the gas. I am moved to tears when I see us engage in rhetoric that seems to celebrate anyone’s suffering. 

I do not have all the answers. I will continue to learn and listen.

I am sad to report that crowd level seems to be back to pre-pandemic levels and for myself I think this will be my last time here unless it’s in the dead of winter when there are likely to be less tourists (?) as being part of over-tourism for a place nearly being loved to death, doesn’t feel really good. I need to do more research and talk to more people that live here before I make any final decisions. 

What are your thoughts on over-tourism or visiting Venice? 

The city is seeking to combat over-tourism with a tax for day trippers and other tourists that I’ve outlined on my blog. I personally think it’s a good move. And I will be curious to see what residents like my friend @neumarc think as it gets implemented and we see whether or not it has a positive impact. 

Venice also banned large cruise ships from the Venetian Lagoon as it caused intense damage to the ecosystem when they were allowed. Speaking of cruises, I’m in Italy to head to the port and fishing town of Chiaggio where we are joining @vikingcruises for their “Empires of the Mediterranean” sailing. It is Dante’s first time on a cruise and Viking is one of the only lines I will go on an ocean cruise with because their ship has a passenger capacity less then 1/3 the size of the average for the industry. They also seem to be making honest strides to ensure they operate in ways that are as responsible and ethical as possible. I’ve also never met an employee who didn’t LOVE working for Viking. The ones I’ve met when on the river and one ocean cruise so far have been some of the happiest tourism employees I’ve found the world over.

This is starting to sound like a commercial 😂 and I didn’t mean to do that. But I am grateful to be hosted by Viking again so I can share more about them. AMA in the comments and I’ll answer honestly ⤵️

Thank you for making it this far. I hope your week is off to a great start ❤️

Following my introduction to Venezuelan arepas at @amarachocolate, her idea and a very good one!, we spent all day in the @thehuntingtonlibrary gardens deep in discussion about life and in frequent meditation over the smallest details. I learned more about her incredible work as a set photographer for film and TV, please check out her work at the link in her profile. Occasionally we paused to do nothing more than watch koi pass in and out of the colorful reflections on otherwise still bodies of water; both marveling at finding someone else we could do that with who didn’t feel it was wasted time. It was such a treat to deepen the friendship that began in Utah. 

I can’t put into words how grateful I am to the Sony family of brands for hosting me in a place where I could learn about their Create Action initiative; and that brought together so many phenomenal people like Jen, Brooke, Autumn, Nancy, Endia, Stormy, Kayla, Amber, Michelle, Monica, Michaela, Sapna, Juan, [and more!] who made me feel so welcome but also so seen.
