In the 67 countries around the world that criminalize same-sex activity between consenting adults, it is another day in which LGBTQ couples must keep their love hidden. J & Q (names withheld for their safety) are from #Uganda. They told me that in their country ‚Äúlesbianism is an abnormality‚Ä¶ a disease that needs to be cured.‚Äù They are married but their union is not recognized by Ugandan law. ‚ÄúWe never feel safe,‚Äù they say. ‚ÄúLiving in Uganda as a lesbian [is] a dangerous thing.‚Äù So they pretend to be sisters, moving house regularly to avoid suspicious neighbors. All they want is to ‚Äúlive a more peaceful life, even if it‚Äôs a closeted one‚Äù.

Their story, like many from my long-term project #WhereLoveIsIllegal, sheds light on the harsh reality of life for #LGBTQ people in societies where they are criminalized for who they are and who they love.
