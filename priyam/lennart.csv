Many of you requested prints of my recent photo of Cologne‘s march against racism. This sparked the idea for a special print sale: From today until tuesday, ALL PROFIT from ANY of my prints will be donated to @sarah.seenotrettung, an NGO here to save lives in the Mediterranean. Together, we can make a change! 💪

Thanks @photocircle for supporting the mission and making it possible. Hit the link in my bio for my @photocircle print collection, featuring all of these photos and some more.

Last night I joined 30 000 people in the streets of Cologne to protest against racism in Germany.
Why? In Germany, politicians of the far-right party (AfD) have openly admitted their plans of mass deportations and depriving Germans with migrational history of their citizenship. While the AfD‘s racist and anti-humanistic views are disgusting to most Germans, the party has been gaining huge support in national and regional opinion polls and many AfD supporters are calling for an ethnic and political cleansing. Does this sound familiar to something that happend in Germany not even 100 years ago? Unfortunately yes. Time to stand up.

Long after the sun had set I decided to send up my drone just to see what it would look like. Unreal! The soft light of the fading day gave this place a whole new appearance.

An rather unusual set of photos on this account, but somehow Oman inspired me to shoot more local culture and people. I don’t like being a camera-in-peoples-faces-tourist, so here’s a set of portraits from a far. A couple notes about each of these shots:

1. 📍Fort Nizwa - I liked how the soft light matched the rounded shapes of this historical landmark.

2. 📍Wahiba Sands - I was snapping portraits of a camel when suddenly a truck with smiling Omani passed by. Big fan of the camel’s lip.

3. 📍Nizwa - Blue hour, neon lights and a lonely chair. I really enjoyed this scene, especially as two men walked by.

4. 📍Sur harbour - I was snapping photos on a mountain by the bay when this heroic fisherman cruised through the scene.

5. 📍Bidiyah - It was midday, but the smoke from burnt palm leaves created a soft atmosphere among the palm trees. 

6. 📍Somewhere in between - I loved the old Toyota trucks I saw all over Oman. Fun fact: the boy drove off by himself moments later.

7. 📍Nizwa - Two strangers walking down jewellery lane. I really liked the look of the large arabic signs on every business. 

8. 📍Sur beach - Loved watching all the different activities on the beach. Men landing boats, Women picknicking by the car, kids playing in the water, dogs, birds, everything.

9. 📍Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque - A family chilling on the steps of one of the worlds largest mosques. If felt truly peaceful.

This might be the longest caption ever, but I thought some people might enjoy the extra insights. Did you? 🤚

My dear friend @muenchmax just launched his huge passion project. World, say hi to @followthetracks.oman! 🐪⛺️Max spent the past year planning and setting up every little detail of this self-driving experience so that anyone who books the tour can travel without worrying about details. Just come to Oman, pick up your fully equipped 4x4, fire up the tablet and follow the tracks. I had the privilege of testing the tour and absolutely loved it! This way of traveling allowed me to be more present as I didn’t have to plan anything before or during the trip. Where to go? What to do? Where to sleep? The @followthetracks.oman app had all the answers. A personal highlight: sending it through the desert, sleeping in roof tents below a million stars and waking up to camels saying hi. Thanks @muenchmax and @followthetracks.oman for introducing me to this marvelous country I knew so little about. I can’t wait to return! ✨
