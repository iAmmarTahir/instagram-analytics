Many people don’t know that Tyson is a rainbow baby🌈👶🏽. For those that don’t know what that means, it’s that Tyson came after us miscarrying our baby before him. It’s taken a few years to decide if we wanted to share this, and just as long to feel comfortable taking about it. 

After hearing of struggles to get pregnant and miscarriages from people around us, we felt that we wanted to share so that others going through this feel less alone, as well as to give some hope. 

In early 2017, my husband and I got the wonderful news that we were going to have a baby, we were ecstatic and began planning for this blessed baby's arrival. I chatted with the baby regularly, and planned its nursery, planned our announcement etc. 

Then suddenly, just past 12 weeks, we lost our beloved baby. The pain, sadness and loneliness that goes along with this was unimaginable. I’m not sure why there is so much secrecy around a miscarriage here in North America, it’s makes it so much worse. 

Not everything was ‘evacuated’ when it happened so I was still carrying the baby after the miscarriage. When I asked my doctor what to do, she said I had to wait for it to pass naturally (which isn’t true for everyone) 😞

For 9 months I still had all the hormones and the baby which made it so much harder to get past what happened. When I eventually found a new doctor, she took care of me and helped us to complete this chapter. We were finally able to mourn & have closure. When we were ready, we tried again 😀

We are thankful that all the stars aligned to bring us the most special gift of our life, and the following year we got the news that we were pregnant again and Tyson was on his way. The main reason to share this story is to give hope to those out there going though some of the challenges of this. We send love to our little angel in heaven, and thanks for our little Tyson. 

 Sending hope, love & baby dust to anyone in need… hugs xoxo ❤️🙏🏼🌈

Weight can fluctuate for various reasons like water retention (think salty meals, workouts, or hormones) and other factors beyond fat gain. ⁣Remember, it’s just one piece of the puzzle!⁣
⁣
The scale provides data, but a sudden increase doesn’t mean you’ve gained fat. 

Trust the process!  For instance, after a heavy workout, your body might retain water to aid muscle repair, causing a temporary increase.⁣
⁣
Focus on progress beyond the numbers—because you’re more than a digit!  Celebrate victories that go beyond the scale. 🎉 

Notice how your clothes fit better, feel the increased energy levels, revel in improved sleep quality, and relish in the compliments you receive.⁣

Are you have trouble drinking enough water everyday?? 💦 

I can help!! 👊🏼❤️

I want to show you one of my favorite hacks for getting my daily water in! Now ideally you wanna aim to get in 2 to 3 liters of water in per day. I know!

 That’s a loooottta of water! And if you are not used to drinking so much water, there is definitely a learning curve! Below you will find my tip for staying hydrated and a trick on how to make water taste yummy!

Infused watermelon and basil  water 🍉 🌿   

The flavor is a water melony with a hint of basil, but, the scent of the basil as you drink it is intoxicating. Scrunch the basil in your hands before adding to the water to increase the flavor. Give it at least 2 hours in the fridge to soak up the flavor.

I like to let all infused water sit at least 2 hours but not more than two days before drinking.  You can make little waters like this or make one big jug to finish that day. Try to use organic produce and wash everything thoroughly.

Get that water in people! 😘✌🏼 Xoxo

Just smashed a quick assault bike session – proof that you don’t need hours to see results! 💪

HIIT is my go-to for supercharging fat loss in minimal time. Alternating between intense bursts and rest periods keeps that metabolism on fire, torching calories even post-workout. 

But here’s the hack: choose intense cardio like uphill sprints, burpees, or the assault bike to crank up the burn. Short, sweet, and seriously effective. 

Whether you’re a fitness pro or just starting, 4 minutes on the assault bike can make a world of difference. It’s not about time; it’s about intensity. 

Let’s crush those fitness goals together! 😘✌🏼 xoxo
