🇨🇺 Havana, we spent a couple of days exploring the beautiful city of Havana where we ate at well known restaurants such as La Bodeguita Del Medio, had drinks on the rooftop of the Kempinski Hotel overlooking the Capitol and the Great Theatre of Havana, watched the famous Tropicana Show which has been going since 1939, walked the streets until our feet hurt and took a ride in a hot pink convertible classic car! 🚗 

🇨🇺 Santiago De Cuba, a 1 hour flight from Havana. We spent a few days exploring the bustling town of Santiago de Cuba and nearby places such as La Gran Piedra, the Cobre Basilica and El Morro castle before going on a bus ride to Baracoa stopping off at the most Wastern point in Cuba called Maisi ⛪️ 

🇨🇺 Baracoa, the oldest city and one of the most charming in Cuba. Located in the Guantanamo province, this Cuban jewel is hidden among mountain ranges and beautiful beaches. We visited black beaches, chocolate farms and cruised down the river in Yumuri Canyon 🚣‍♂️

One very bumpy bus ride later we arrived at the gorgeous…

🇨🇺 Cayo Saetia, here we spent the day swimming, eating, riding horses and relaxing in the stunning nature and the most turquoise sea. We then had a sunset cruise on a catamaran towards Holguin with lots of music and drinks 🍹 

All in all such a memorable and eye opening trip. Learnt a lot, met some great people and made memories for life! ❤️

Here are some tips for budget friendly trips:

✈️ *Avoid Peak Season* Not only a way to avoid crowds but you’ll usually be able to get a better deal. You might not be able to guarantee nice weather, but your destination will at least be a lot less crowded!

✈️ *Book in Advance* Prices will often go up as time gets closer to your trip. Booking train journeys, accommodation & flights ahead of time guarantees you won’t get stung by a last minute expensive prices.

✈️ *Purchase travel insurance* It may seem like an additional upfront expense, but it’s best to view it as an investment that can help you save money during medical emergencies and unexpected cancellations.

✈️ *Using public transportation* during your trip can save you money. The bus or whatever the local transport of the country you’re visiting is always cheaper than a taxi or an Uber. Walking is my personal favourite way to discover anywhere! 

✈️ *Choose cheaper accommodation* Hotels can be quite expensive so choose a more budget friendly stay such as a hostel or apartment. 

✈️ *Pack light* to avoid baggage expenses. Airports impose pretty hefty extra fees for large and heavy baggage. Also pack well, write lists (I have a notes app full of them😄) so you don’t forget anything and have to buy duplicate things abroad that you already have at home. 

✈️ *Eat Local* Stay away from the touristy areas. You can often see places that are popular with the locals, they serve cheaper food and you’ll get a much more authentic look into the cuisine of that country!

✈️ *Save up frequent flyer miles* It’s definitely worth joining a frequent flyer program & racking up those miles/points. Over time they really add up and can get you discounted flights and upgrades!

✈️ *Bring your own food* Whenever possible, stock up on sandwiches and snacks for the trip. Avoid buying meals at the airport/on the road/hotel minibar which are £££.

✈️ *Skip overpriced Tours* Explore yourself, with the information available online, it’s simple and easy to conduct your own tour for free rather than paying for a guide.

4140744,izkiz,C19vXo6It8O,True,"Snippets from our cosy stay at South Lodge hotel in Horsham. 🏡 Boasting beautiful views across the South Downs, South Lodge is a five-star quintessential country house hotel tucked away in the West Sussex countryside. Located only 1.5 hours from London, South Lodge is the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life. We spent 2 days there relaxing, enjoying the spa, delicious food & the peace and quiet. 🌿

🛌 Our room, Elizabeth La Bay, was stunning, spacious and modern with a big bed and sprawling views over the grounds (and the downs) 🌳 A fun fact about our room is during the war Sir Winston Churchill stayed at South Lodge on occasion. A lift was believed to have taken him directly up to his favoured room, the ‘Elizabeth Le Bay room’ 

🧖‍♀️ The spa is amazing with a swimming pool, sauna, marble salt room, aromatic steam room, ice bucket shower and a stage of the art gym. Outside you’ll find a heated hydrotherapy infinity pool, plus a wild swimming pond which I spent over 30 minutes splashing around amongst the reeds before warming up with a delicious supper in Botanic, the spa’s Mediterranean influenced restaurant. 

Our stay short but sweet and we felt throughly rested when we left and I would highly recommend a visit to South Lodge. ♥️
