200355286,jamesalexanderellis,CxhqAU7os4v,False,"If you’re NEW to my page, here’s a brief professional history of me 😳

👦🏻 Firstly, I certainly wasn’t always an athlete or any kind of “model”. I was a pretty chunky teenager! An only child in a single-parent family that probably needed a bit more attention…

📚 Before I qualified as a PT (way back in 2010) I was a full time residential Architect and also a part time club DJ. Funny combo right?

📝 My first PT job was at LA Fitness in my hometown of Cheltenham (U.K.) 13 years ago 😮 I was SO excited. I used to walk around with a clipboard (no iPad) and a stopwatch around my neck!

💪🏽 I’d already been devoted to bodybuilding for many years before I became a PT, but this career move REALLY kicked me into obsession. I won @miami.pro & went to compete as a WBFF Pro and win money for prancing around in #Vegas!

💰As time went on my profile increased & I was one of the lucky athletes that had an actual paid sponsorship. I was lead athlete @scimx for 4 years. Taken to expos, I did countless interviews and started to build a massive following.

👨‍🏫 In 2015 I started mentoring other trainers and became the PT manager at @gymboxofficial in London - nurturing all the new graduates how to run their PT business.

📷 In 2018 I achieved a lifelong dream of making the Muscle & Fitness cover. I had read and adored the magazine since I was 18!!

👴🏻 After this I decided to “retire” from the physique obsession and competing. I’d had an amazing few years but I knew it wasn’t exactly “healthy” 💊 and I wanted to focus more on my Coaching. This was tough!

🚴🏼‍♂️ Moving away from bodybuilding came with a slight personal identity crisis…..and I needed something else to distract me so I started doing Road Cycling (and still do!) When you try riding a bike uphill fast with ACTUAL fit people, and your ego gets ground to dust 💀

🇳🇿 Fast forward to 2022 and I decide with @miki_ferris that London life was way too busy, & transient and we fancied a diffrerent lifestyle. So we shipped our lives over to New Zealand!

​(Swipe across ⏩⏩⏩)
​
​Improvements to health, body composition and fitness are only ever sustainable when taken steadily, and with goals set around a period of weeks, months and (yes even) years
​
​You didn’t get overweight in 4 weeks so why expect to reverse it that quickly?
​
​If you’re not fit and can’t run a marathon at the moment, why do you think you can do it after just 2 weeks or training?
​
​Attempting to lose weight too fast only causes a trainee to restrict too much, cutting out food types, cutting too many calories. Working out twice a day every day for a week and then falling off the wagon.
​
​Many of you will be nodding to yourselves at this!?
​
​My client Jay @j.p.john_anthony started his journey with me over a year ago, swipe across to see how the coaching worked: fortnightly check ins, daily accountability, and regular photo submissions!
​
​None of it is complex. No magic tricks. You just have to show up and want it badly.
​
​I look forward to helping him get a little more bodyfat off, so he can complete his original goal of looking like a move villain 😝

It’s not my sole intention for new clients, BUT they are always happy when it happens quickly. Who wouldn’t be?

My coaching program begins with a 90 day timeframe to keep the guys FOCUSED and keep their eyes on the clock, as men tend to do better with that sort of structure 

@adam_the_barber1 lost 10kg in 90 days, @charles.glass  dropped 12kg in 90 days, @craig_jackson86 lost fat AND gained muscle in just 30 days! He’s barely started…

Daryl and Matt aren’t on IG but they also made impressive and rapid fat loss… 9kg and 5kg in 3 months respectively 🥳

If you’ve been delaying things so far this year, and you want to get in shape and feel good about yourself again, drop me DM today with the word “interested” and I’ll have a quick chat with you!
