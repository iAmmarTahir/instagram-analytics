This winter, so far, the ice conditions in Romsdal have been great, and one of my fav evening sessions has been to do some loops on the icefall behind our home. It‚Äôs a good way to train endurance during the day and work on technique in the evening.

Are you also a fan of training or going outdoors at night?

12186437,kilianjornet,C3k-JBbM_2T,True,"Morning session done: goal was to change rhythms to target high zones (Z4, Z5) without reaching fatigue.

In my daily training, controlling the intensity is crucial to ensure I‚Äôm stimulating my body correctly without overdoing it or falling short. I‚Äôve relied on two key metrics: RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion), which takes practice to gauge accurately, and heart rate monitoring. 

For this, I‚Äôve shifted from traditional chest straps to the @corosglobal heart rate monitor. The device sits snugly on the bicep. Not only is it more comfortable, but it‚Äôs also just as precise, if not more, in capturing heart rate data. It also connects via Bluetooth to any watch, not just COROS (although, I am biased üòä).

With this 2 things and the time of exercise I can calculate the training load to control that I‚Äôm doing what I‚Äôve planned.

12186437,kilianjornet,C3TAv3WIhPN,False,"You may remember the video we posted pulling the sled on a family adventure. 

That is what we wanted to talk about to you today: the balance between family life & life as an elite athlete.

During the week, now that both girls are going to kindergarten, we have about 6 hours to train and work. 

Emelie‚Äôs training, time in the garden with Moonvalley, and Kilian‚Äôs training with NNormal and research. 

If we want to do a second session, it is often in the gym while the kids are sleeping.
When the kids are home for holidays or sick (yes, that happens often when viruses spread in kindergarten), we often train inside in the gym, or we alternate between morning/afternoon to train and be with them.

On the weekends, we prioritize being together. We often do a short session in the gym early in the morning and then spend the day doing activities with the kids.

Probably what has changed the most is that now we spend most of our time at home. Before, we organized our lives around races, with lots of traveling. 

Now, it‚Äôs the opposite; we plan for a calendar with few races or projects so we spend most of the year at home. 

Since both our parents live far away, we see if we can meet them around a race so we can also run the same race together.

In the end, it‚Äôs about being organized and finding a balance between all the things we want and need to do, sometimes compromising but prioritizing family time and training.

Adding to this, because not all training is about performance, pace, or speed, come our adventures as a family. And these are the best. We take the opportunity to explore Norway‚Äôs nature together.

The decision to move to Norway was based on what we thought was best for us as parents and as athletes: living more peacefully, slowly, close to nature, where we know we have everything we seek and need for our well-being.
We don‚Äôt want this text to make it seem like everything is perfect because it‚Äôs not. There are unforeseen situations. There are days when it‚Äôs easier to stick to the plan than others. 

In the end, it‚Äôs about adapting to each situation and not stressing about it but making the best of it.
