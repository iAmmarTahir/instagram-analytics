Karla @kchete77 just presented our cumbia project at the National Geographic Storytellers Summit in Los Angeles! She hit it out of the park! Accompanied by music (@loswachiwara) and dancers (@wepa_lows), the show was a total success, a real taste of cumbia and how powerful it is! Here are a few of our phone photos from the Colombian Coast, where cumbia was born, and Monterrey, Mexico, one of the many places it was re-born and has flourished. This project is ongoing and is funded by @insidenatgeo. Karla and I are working with fellow @runa_photos member, Raul Amaru (@amarulero), and with Michelle Gachet (@mgachet). Please stay tuned as this project develops.
 
Thanks for all the support from family and friends!!!
It’s been awesome to work with @spaghetticumbia!

Veronica, as Mexico’s cultural icon La Calavera Catrina, stands with her two boys, Aiden and Samson, who are dressed as characters from the film “Nacho Libre.“

Celebrated all over the world, Día de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead) is a Mexican holiday in which people remember their ancestors. Many build altars, or ofrendas, to honor them, and ply them with items such as the deceased person’s favorite food. La Calavera Catrina originated from an etching by Mexican illustrator José Guadalupe Posada in the early 20th century. The etching satirizes the country’s elite just before the Mexican revolution. La Catrina is a popular costume tied to El Día de los Muertos and central to Mexican identity.

El Camino Real de Baja California runs from Tijuana to Loreto, Mexico. Many are familiar with El Camino Real of Alta California (modern-day California), which is lined with bells and passes through cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The old road in Baja has been forgotten, even though it played a massive role in the development of the whole region. The roads were originally trails made by the indigenous communities of the region, whose people were killed, died from diseases and were used as slave labor to build the road by the Spanish.

“I feel that it was circumstance, not good or bad, just something that happened. We are the people who assign meaning to things or situations; therefore, we can see it in a positive or negative light, the important thing, I think, is being able to face it in the best way.” -Frank Baus (@frank.baus)
 
When Tungarahua erupted in 2006, the village of Palictagua was hit by lava and toxic gasses in the middle of the night and the people had to run for their lives. Instead of staying in the safe zone, Frank ran back to pull his grandmother, Carmelina from the disaster. Tragically, she died later. Frank was left with 2nd and 3rd degree burns over 80 percent of his body. he was later flown to Boston for reconstructive surgery.
