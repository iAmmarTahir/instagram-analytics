10274566,jimrichardsonng,CoVXydKPpN5,False,"Scotland Fix of the Day: There are days in Scotland where I relish nothing so wonderful but the fresh breeze on an island shore, rain racing away to reveal a bright landscape, or the melancholy of clouds gathering at sunset. Right now, in the depth of winter, it might be worth thinking forward to such times coming again – and hatching a plan to be there when they do. 

Island locations: 
1. Berneray in the Outer Hebrides
2. Westray in Orkney
3. Fair Isle
4. Isle of Lewis
5. Isle of Harris

10274566,jimrichardsonng,CzMMRyQL03l,False,"Scotland Fix of the Day: Scottish landscapes loom large in my photographic world so I'm very pleased to share that The Independent Photographer has a new profile about me that shines quite a bit of light into my photography and background. All credit to Josh Bright for pulling it together so brilliantly. (He's more generous than I deserve but I'm not arguing.) Most of all I appreciate the chance to talk about why landscapes are so important to me, why they speak not just to geography but also to our hearts and souls. I'll also be judging their 2023 landscape awards so it's an added chance to connect with beloved places and photography.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C1fRd5QR90B,False,"Looking for Scotland: If Scotland is on your travel list for 2024 let me offer my Top Ten Things To Do. Everybody has their list of Best Castles and Must See sites. With my list I hope to suggest ways of seeing Scotland that might get you away from checklist travel and into another realm. Here goes:

1. Visit a castle (of course) but let the history wash over you. Do a deep dive into its turns of fortune, failures and disasters. Eilean Donan is a good one. 
2. Find a Highland Games in some remote glen. Take part in the gathering, however you can. If they have a visitors tug of war, pull for all your worth. If they have a dance, dance.
3. Find a remote country house hotel that knows Scottish hospitality. Let them spoil you for a couple of days. I’d hole up in Eilean Iarmain on Skye.
4. Sit amongst the puffins. Be patient.
5. Find someplace with stonking, bloody Scottish history. Iona is just one of many, but it’s got Celtic Saints, Viking raids and Macbeth in the graveyard.
6. Visit a coastal village with one pub. Buy somebody a pint. Pennan is a likely choice, but watch Local Hero before you go. 
7. Be picky about which distillery you visit. Avoid glitz. Strathisla is one of those ancient distilleries that still looks old…because it actually is. 
8. Lie down in the heather and take a nap.
9. Find a red phone booth that is still working and call someone. 
10. Spend an evening at a stone circle in the moonlight. The Stones of Stenness in Orkney is a good bet. 

There’s more, of course, and much I have yet to see myself. Before you go buy Scotland, the Best by Peter Irvine, the hands down best Scottish guide book. Relish its handpicked lists of treasures and oddities long before you go.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C4BPin3rggy,False,"Scotland Fix: Few settings seem so right for listening to the Great Highland Bagpipe as a rainy day at the head of Loch Shiel. Here at the Glennfinnan Gathering the piping competition takes place down by the shore, the very place where Bonnie Prince Charlie came ashore on his ill-fated Jacobite mission. The bagpiper is concentrating as he plays the piobaireachd, the ancient classical music set down in the mists of lost history and still revered today. He paces around the platform, ""slowly, but not too slowly"" in precise, measured steps. The judge stares into the distance, careful to not let the magnificent, romantic scene cloud his judgement. Judge and piper share a quest to keep alive something that could die without them. For a bagpiper, I think, this is Carnegie Hall.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C32sT4aLvxM,True,"Scotland Fix of the Day: Scottish landscapes — like the Hairy Loch on the Isle of Skye — have a special drama to them, something that goes beyond the mere picturesque, something that goes to the soul of an ancient land. But telling their story is never as simple as just getting a dramatic landscape corralled inside a camera frame. And it’s always possible that showing less tells a more interesting story than showing more. My practice is to try every compositional option that I can while the light lasts.  I can decide later what worked best. 

By the way, the Hairy Loch has its share of legends attached, some quite morbid. Do these tales add color for you, or put you off?

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C3gu8ReNNWC,True,"Scottish landscapes reveal much of Scottish character, especially out in the islands where the Atlantic storms do battle with the land. So it was that a sodden pony on North Uist taught me a lesson on rainy day. 

It sidled up next to my car, refusing to go stand a ways off in the moor to make a pretty picture for me, a picture that did not involve a soggy mane. But then it dawned on me: the soggy mane was the picture, a pattern of ringlets redolent of Celtic symbols seen here a thousand years ago. 

Sometimes I’m afraid that the land is trying to tell me something and I won’t get it. Over fifty years of photography that has happened to me plenty of times. It’s daunting to think that you can be standing in front of something wonderful, and just not be able to see it. So I thank this pony for its patience. It stood there long enough for me to get it. 

Had any stories of revelations that got away?  Comments welcome.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C3dWNqIxqSv,True,"In Scotland the right light can produce magic on the landscape. Such was the case when Loch Cill Chriosd lit up with the first rays of sunrise that morning as I was driving back from Elgol on the Isle of Skye. 

By the way, locals call it the Hairy Loch for good reason owing to these grasses. It’s often calm and a prime photo stop on the Isle of Skye — if the midgies are held at bay. 

Lots of legends attached to this place, that St. Columba drove away an evil spirit in 570 AD (he did that a lot), that a shape shifting water horse (Kelpie) took up residence and in the form of a handsome young man lured maidens to their death in the loch, even that a Norwegian princess named Saucy Mary is buried on top of Beinn na Caillich back there.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C3JDGRSxskV,False,"Scotland Fix of the Day: Getting away sometimes leads to finding yourself. That’s one attraction of the Scottish landscape for me, the chance to truly be alone with the place, unfettered with expectations, content to accept the character of the land (and of yourself) as it is. Here are a few places that have evoked that sense for me. 

1. The long one-track road on Jura that ends after 17 miles just south of the house where George Orwell wrote 1984.
2. Eilean na Moine, the wee island in Loch Eilt that became most known as the site of Dumbledore’s grave. Few other island seem to stand so alone. 
3. The moors of Assynt stretch off into vast openness when seen from atop Sgorr Tuath, or from Stac Pollaidh across the way. 
4. Evening at the Ring of Brodgar in Orkney can be sublime, the stones — and endless time — your only companions. I’ve often felt comforted here. 

Are you one of the travelers who seek out such solitude, even loneliness, in the landscape.

10274566,jimrichardsonng,C20c34jRPsx,False,"Scotland Fix of the Day: Seaside villages in Scotland have always beckoned to me, evoking romantic ideals of another life, another way of living. Actual life has a way of being more complicated, of course, but exploring these communities (in all their variety) speaks to an inner longing that I tugs at me. 
 
1. Pennan sit snug along the base of the cliff on the Moray Firth, perhaps one of the most iconic of seaside villages.
2. Port Ellen on Islay is another of those planned communities that stretch along the shore with colorful boats pulled up onto the grass.
3. Craighouse on Jura can’t be very big because the whole island is only 200 people, but it offers quiet views of the bay from the bench by the war memorial.
4. Stromness in Orkney sidles along the bay, originally laid out when when sea captains bound for Canada and the Antarctic built their houses with a dock out back. 
5. St. Andrews Cathedral offers spectacular views down on the ruins and the graveyard from atop St. Rule’s Tower, views that stretch off to the famous strand. 
6. Pierowall on Westray, circles the bay, a North Sea village dating back through history like a chronicle of archeological ages, at least as far back as the Neolithic. 
7. Elgol on the Isle of Skye probably has more boats than houses. There is a school and a pier with views out to Rum in the distance, and stunning rock formations washed endlessly by the sea. 

I’m still exploring seaside villages. Which ones do you recommend? I’ll add them to my list. Thanks.
