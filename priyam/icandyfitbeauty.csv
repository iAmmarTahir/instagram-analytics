To my baby girl thank you for completing our family, I can’t wait to do all the things with you 🩷 

Brué is already taking his big brother's duties seriously. He’s such a good helper and loves giving sissy kisses. I can’t wait for when they can play together.  We had no issues with him welcoming her home. 

I have reclaimed my time and stopped pumping milk because of that I’ve been getting more sleep and things are easier the second time around. I produce so much milk with Brué (oversupply I was always engorged, always in pain and nothing seemed to slow down my production. (Maybe pcos and high prolactin) Not sure?!

My anxiety was at an all-time high and looking back I was unhappy, and irritated because of it but I kept doing it because I thought I needed to. I still have a deep freezer full of milk from Brué. I should have gone into business selling milk bricks. 

My business name would have been The Real Muscle Milk 😂🤣 I hear my fellow bodybuilders are in need of mother milk 📲 DM and I'll be your supplier 🤣 all jokes but $8 an oz is tempting.

Baby girl is around 6 lbs and momma is up 30 lbs which is a big drop from my first pregnancy. I gained a total of 50lbs and he was born 40+6 days at 7lb 9oz

I’m currently 1cm dilated and I’m so ecstatic about it because it lets me know progress is happening with a step closer to welcoming our baby girl home. 

Although I’m so over being pregnant these last few weeks I can’t help but get emotional 🥹 how grateful I am to carry my second child full-term. 

I spent years hating my body disliking myself because I felt my body was broken and working against me as we struggled with infertility and PCOS. 

This was extremely challenging for me, because over the years during my bodybuilding times, I had so much confidence in my body’s abilities to do what I wanted it to do. 

There's a blessing in every struggle so today I'm humbled and grateful for this journey because life is so sweet with my babies B&B
