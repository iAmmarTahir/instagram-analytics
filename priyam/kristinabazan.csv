178890701,kristinabazan,CoKvDNdjKA6,False,"Here it is!!! My new book “Through the Veils of Mystery” is now available and ready to make it’s way to your bookshelf @thoughtcatalog @shopcatalog (link in bio)🪐✨🤍 In yesterday’s live I explained to you guys how much this book means to me and how it has been healing my heart for the last two years as channeled work, soothing my nervous system and stretching my belief system. There is so much I haven’t shared with you guys about what I went through end of 2019 simply because I felt like it needed the right frame to honor what occurred. In this book I reveal the details of what I call my “awakening process”. The second part of the book is an initiation through poetry into your own self revelation. It is structured in a way to access the subconscious mind and retrieve lost memories. Many of you have witnessed a massive transformation in my life and it’s true. I’ve reconnected with parts of myself which I had lost, which were broken and fragmented. The words of this book came through higher planes as pure medicine when my soul was ready to receive it, soothing my wounds and applying healing balm onto them. “Through the Veils of Mystery” is a divine reclamation of our power. The power we gave away, to lovers, friendships, careers, family members. This book is a profound healing template and support for those ready to truly meet themselves : all of themselves and to face the truth of their divinity. To make peace with that word beyond any and all dogma. The words of this book have been healing me in such profound ways and I know they will find those that are meant to read it. Those ready to heal and rise in oneness. Thank you @thoughtcatalog for believing unequivocally in this book and it’s gentle yet fierce transformative power. I am the humble messenger of this text, and it is an honor to share it now with you as it has been shared onto me through the invisible realms 🤍

178890701,kristinabazan,Cws3sZhrIiJ,False,"IT’S HERE 🌙✨ After months of work and dozens of people testing out the course prior to it’s official launch, I am so infinitely honored, from the bottom of my heart to share this big piece of work with you, my new online course : The Art of Self-Revelation Module 1.

A spiritual path of magic and divinity is one of Self-Revelation as we realize that it was always about meeting our own authentic self and to alchemize back into wholeness the detrimental constructs of our inner psyche that have been keeping us captive. This course is built in a way so serve you profoundly, viscerally. It has proven incredible results with dozens of people who have seen their lives transform during this course. It humbles me to be able to share the tools I have acquired over years of study, deep inner work and initiation to synthesize it for you so that you don’t need to go through the same laborious pathway : you directly receive the essence as you are guided to the shores of your own meeting.

This course is about reconnecting with your own inherent MAGIC and sacred wisdom. Remembering and activating those dormant keys within your own psyche. 

MODULE 1 is structured in 4 Parts.

💫 Part 1 - Introduction 

We lay the groundwork, the foundation for deep healing and 
transformation to occur. 

💫 Part 2 - Source Wound

We focus and target the wound that is hindering your progress in this lifetime and begin shifting your relationship to this reality.

💫 Part 3 - Shadow Work

You will meet your shadow and reconnect with hidden parts of yourself through a deep shadow work healing journey.

💫 Part 4 - Soul Fragment Retrieval

People who have suffered trauma often have their emotional body crystalized around a memory, a choc. In this part of the course you will voyage through holotropic breathwork to retrieve lost memories and bring your energy body back into wholeness.

There is so much more to say about this course 🪐 If you are ready for this, the link is in my bio now! Or dm me « MAGIC » and I will send you a link for enrollment.

The Art of Self-Revelation MODULE 1 : This course is a self-study offering, meaning you can do it at your own rhythm as it is designed to fit into a busy schedule. 

🌀This course isn’t  « spiritual fast food », it’s a ressource of immense wealth into which months of work and care have been poured into. 

🌀Financial investment is absolutely key to honor a graceful energy exchange and especially as an act of commitment and an indicator that you are ready to take your healing/transformational path seriously and thus this course seriously. As such, financial investment becomes spiritual investment and especially an investment into your own self. 

🌀For the price of two massages or two healing sessions with a practitioner, you get a lifetime access to +6hours of in depth activating video content, a PDF work book, 1 shadow work healing meditation, shadow work journaling prompts + a soul fragment retrieval holotropic breathwork journey and so much more. It’s filled with blessings and surprises.

🌀 This course has been created with the intention to serve your highest and best good as well as the highest and best good of the collective. By virtue of that, the prayer that has been held during the creation of this program is that any and all student investing into themselves through the means of choosing this path get their financial investment back ten times fold.

🌀This course is deeply transformative and geared towards results as the testimonials of the early-bird participants share. Results are guaranteed if you commit and take it seriously. 

🌀It’s a course I wish I had when I was in the midst of my dark night of the soul and riddled with anxiety and panic attacks. I wish I had these ressources back then.

🌀This course is… MAGIC

It would be my greatest honor to serve you and assist you on your path of self-revelation as you choose to embrace and embody your divinity and inherent magic, unleashing the authentic song of your soul.
