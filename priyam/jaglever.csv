‚†Ä
It‚Äôs so important that pets are always connected with their families. Whether you‚Äôre a pet owner or an animal lover, there are steps we can all take to keep pets and people together:‚†Ä
‚†Ä
üêæ Reunite: In New York, I‚Äôve seen so many dogs escape their harness and it truly feels like my mission is to help out. I‚Äôve helped friends find lost dogs by posting online and scouring the streets. If you find a lost pet, other helpful tips include checking for ID tags or microchips and knocking on doors nearby where the pet was found.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
üêæ Donate: There are many community organizations that could use some help. Consider donating pet food to local human food pantries so a family with a pet can receive full assistance for the whole family. Pet groomers, pet hospitals, and local veterinary clinics may also accept donations to help those who need assistance in caring for their pet.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
üêæ Short-Term Fostering: Fostering is also a great way to help a pet and studies from the APA show that 86% of people see a positive impact on their mental health when having a pet. I can truly vouch for that! Fostering doesn‚Äôt have to be a long-term commitment either. Sometimes a pet just needs temporary care from someone in their community while their owner travels, recovers from being sick, and/or is hospitalized.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I got Finn as an emotional support animal when I suddenly lost my brother. He means the world to me. According to the APA, 69% of pets owners said their pets help reduce stress and anxiety, and offer companionship. The bond that we can have with our pets is truly something amazing, and it‚Äôs also why it‚Äôs so important to keep people and their pets together.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
I encourage all of you to #BeAHelper with me! For more information, check out the link in my bio or visit PetsandPeopleTogether.org.‚†Ä
‚†Ä
Have you ever helped reunite a pet with their family? I‚Äôd love to hear your stories and experiences üíï‚†Ä
