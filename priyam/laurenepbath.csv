But I‚Äôve recently committed to going back to basics in my life and thought that was worth further explanation here.

In my time on Instagram, I‚Äôve been a chef turned professional Instagrammer and travel photographer. I‚Äôve become a consultant, campaign manager and public speaker. I‚Äôve created an online photography course, co-founded an event and run photography tours to Zimbabwe. I‚Äôve been to all seven continents with paid work, and during Covid, I became a business coach and the Managing Director of a seven-figure startup. Then I gave it all away.

As my successes piled up, I realised that not only did I now know who I was without them, I didn‚Äôt believe that I was enough without them either.

2022 became the year of undoing. I undid my business, stopped chasing the money and adulation, stopped creating and gave myself space to figure out who I am underneath it all. Not only did I find out, but I learned to love myself without any of it.

As I continue to sit into my power, embrace motherhood and find joy in the everyday, I also feel a calling to share my journey. You can read my blogs, subscribe to my emails and turn on post notifications for my Instagram stories if you want to come along.

Afterwards I went back to my room and just cried and cried and I still cry to think about it now. I‚Äôve seen pictures like this in the media and spared them a few minutes of sympathy before moving on with my life, but seeing this with my own eyes affected me fundamentally. These are the long term cages, for animals that have slipped through the cracks. They‚Äôve either been too big to handle or sick with contagious diseases that can‚Äôt enter the main population. Some are just waiting until the resources are there to put them onto a pre release island, some can‚Äôt get along with other orangutans, some have been broken by humans and some are in long term sanctuary and will never have freedom again. Small though these cages are they can cost up to $20,000 and the resources aren‚Äôt there to replace them with better facilities, yet. Although I saw many happy endings for orangutans in Samboja and Nyaru Menteng, I also saw too many animals in these cages. Depressed and dejected, although some are angry still and rattle their cages and spit as you walk by. It‚Äôs the difficult job of the program director here to prioritize cases, move animals around the different facilities and decide which are eligible for release. With so many moving parts they‚Äôre doing a fine job with the resources they have. Please leave a like and comment, even if you don‚Äôt ‚Äòlike‚Äô the situation.

I notice how much I struggle to honour low-energy days. I want to DO things. I get into all kinds of ‚Äústories‚Äù about what it means about me if I‚Äôm not productive.

High-energy days are a lot easier. For me, MY personality. But guess what? When I honour the low-energy days and get through on the bare minimum, the high-energy days are amplified big time!

I had some much slower days last week from Wednesday - Saturday, allowing myself to rest, reflect and turn inwards. From Sunday onwards, WHOA! Energy to BURN!

I‚Äôm really looking forward to experimenting more with this in 2024. It‚Äôs also a wonderful practice to get more into your body and be more present. Paying attention and being aware is the first step to change.

This year, I‚Äôm taking it back to basics! I‚Äôm following a plan of action that is basically the foundation of manifesting. This is how it goes:

1. I am very clear on the life I want for myself and my family. I know exactly what it looks and feels like. What I‚Äôm doing, what I‚Äôm earning, where I‚Äôm living, my lifestyle ‚Ä¶ all the large details are clear. We used to teach this at Bootcamp and Phhnix, and it‚Äôs a crucial part of business and creation: knowing where you‚Äôre going, setting a future vision.

2. I am doing whatever it takes to feel good IN my body. To stay connected to myself and my power. Whenever something takes me out of my body, I use my tools to come back in. The beach, working out, meditation and journaling all play a massive role in maintaining groundedness, gratitude and embodiment.

3. I am taking aligned and inspired action every day and only working on the stuff that is a joy. I‚Äôm creating, writing, shooting, filming, teaching, connecting and pitching. I‚Äôm also setting up the habits of the person I will be when I have my future life. I do things that create space and results.

I‚Äôve learned that if you don‚Äôt create your life, it will be created for you. 2024 is the time to take the power back.",33,482,1705373351,,https://instagram.fkiv3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/419299691_1122175122284364_7501450642758586137_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.fkiv3-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=yn6hlcazVhIAX8tPBjm&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDsy7kgh-OFuR5Feqs1zqRnQ6bTptxKgYU3MW51hSXk6Q&oe=65E54A20&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
8247979,laurenepbath,C2HSBcIvDQy,False,"Whoa. What a weekend! This weekend, I had not one but two kids' birthday parties to attend. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I LOVE them. The party food, the cake, the nostalgia and, of course, the excitement on my kid's faces. Kids parties are great.

They‚Äôre also very, very, very stimulating! And this weekend, I made the rookie error of putting off my journaling and beach visit until afterwards, meaning I was going into each party with my cup empty.

By yesterday afternoon, I was in struggle town. I was in a functional freeze state - disassociating and reaching for the phone for some mindless scrolling. I was highly emotional, very overwhelmed and still highly stimulated. I recognised the state and needed to make decisions to allow me to process and regulate.

I struggled to fall asleep after it all, physically feeling my body twitch as I came down. It‚Äôs a funny thing to know your own limits and still push past them because you don‚Äôt want to miss out. The good news is that I‚Äôm learning. It‚Äôs time to honour my capacity more.

Today, I wanted to ease back into work with some slow and creative tasks, including editing a small gallery of shots from a women‚Äôs circle I attended two weeks ago.

It‚Äôs not an easy thing for me to admit that I‚Äôm not superwoman, for me to know and honour my limits. Although I CAN do a lot, I don‚Äôt want to do a lot if it doesn‚Äôt feel good.

Yesterday afternoon, I didn‚Äôt feel good. This afternoon, I felt very good. I allow the feeling to guide me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

8247979,laurenepbath,C1_fd9lvm1V,False,"I had an interesting day yesterday. I was feeling low on energy and low on motivation. It was probably due to the New Moon, a time for introspection and letting go rather than hustling and DOING.

Naturally, I didn‚Äôt feel like doing a thing and cancelled all the tasks I‚Äôd planned to work on in favour of doing some creative stuff at a snail's pace.

Even though I‚Äôd acknowledged the energy AND consciously chose to work with my (lower) energy, I still found myself getting into stories about it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only week one of being back at work, and you‚Äôre already making excuses; this is why you‚Äôre not going to make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre feeling guilty for not doing much, and guilt is a low-vibration emotion. You know this, and yet you haven‚Äôt even mastered shifting emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even get anything done. How will you do everything you want to do this year?‚Äù

Blah, blah, blah.

But I kept choosing to sit with the discomfort and my inner knowing that we are simply not designed to hustle every single day. We are cyclical beings, and we work best when we allow for that.

This morning, I woke up, and all I wanted to do was create. I started writing like crazy, had an idea for a book and even took my camera down to the beach. This isn‚Äôt the best shot, just the only shot I was able to edit briefly while I was watching the kids. I felt great!

It‚Äôs important to remember on the bad days that the good days are always coming. It will be my practice this year to sink more deeply into my downtime and continue to trust that I will get everything I want. I feel that so hard.

8247979,laurenepbath,C17uUfKSkp7,False,"I‚Äôve spent the last 18 months finding myself amongst the chaos of motherhood, exiting a business I loved and dismantling a set of beliefs that no longer served me.

During that time the biggest gift I gave myself was the gift of space. Space to reflect. Space to be curious about my life. Space to create without pressure. It was quite possibly the most impactful period of my life.

Amongst the many things I learned about myself, and life, is how to pay attention to the cycles. Because I‚Äôm not menstruating (still breastfeeding), I am more strongly impacted by the lunar cycle. My energy, emotions and moments of inspiration are all loosely following the cycles of the moon.

At first I didn‚Äôt notice at all. Then it all seemed coincidental. But today, noticing that it is the new moon and feeling into my body and energy, I feel deeply aligned with it.

The New Moon is a time for reflection and planting seeds for the next cycle. It is not a time to be kicking goals. And I feel that HARD in my body.

To honour how I feel, and the cycles, I‚Äôm adjusting my day today to create more space and execute easier tasks. I can smash out the bulk work when my energy starts to build again.

If you‚Äôre interested to know more about the cycles, I‚Äôve been using @janehardwickecollings app ‚ÄòSpinning Wheels‚Äô and the @magic_of_i .

I know how woo woo this sounds. And I know we live in a society that doesn‚Äôt let us believe we have the space to choose. But we do. Life has so much more meaning when we slow down, honour ourselves and trust that it will all get done.

8247979,laurenepbath,C16cOg-vqHz,False,"Last year I set a modest goal for myself to move my body two times a week.

One of those times was a half hour personal training session at my local private gym, a cost that I definitely could not afford at the time.

But health was high on my list of priorities and I partnered up with a friend to go halves in a 2-on-1 half hour session once a week. It‚Äôs not much. Half an hour.

But I‚Äôll share something with you. That half an hour session, executed just 15 times, has been the catalyst for my new fitness goals for 2024.

Today was my last day doing personal training. For now at least. I‚Äôm joining a gym.

I sat on this decision for a long time because I have so little time to work, and I really didn‚Äôt want my fitness to interfere with my work time. I am also still struggling with motivation, which was the reason why I needed a personal trainer in the first place.

Then, in an instant brainwave, I realised that I could find a gym with a cr√®che that runs group fitness classes and train in my parenting hours. (Dreamboat and I equally split parenting hours and working hours.)

I‚Äôve tested it out and my kids LOVED the cr√®che! And I loved getting back on a spin bike again. I was grinning from ear to ear.

The point of my story is twofold. One is that you don‚Äôt need to go from zero to a hundred. A year of gently adapting to exercise again created the momentum to set bigger goals this year. I‚Äôve got my whole life to get my fitness on track. This year I hope to move my body four times a week, upping the ante on the intensity.

The second lesson is this, no matter what your personal circumstances are, there is a solution to your challenges. I have two babies and a business to restart in less than 25 hours a week. I also have zero motivation to exercise of my own accord. But I sat into the problem and found the solution. There is ALWAYS a solution.

Wish me luck on my fitness journey. ‚ù§Ô∏è

8247979,laurenepbath,C128EbayPVk,False,"Everywhere I look, I see people I love and admire talking about their yearly planning and sharing their processes.

I love planning. During the Phhnix days, I was a staunch defender of planning and saw first-hand how planning creates the structure to achieve any goal. It‚Äôs an infallible system.

I also find planning to be personally suffocating. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs remnants of the business PTSD I have (joking, but also not), some other type of block or internal resistance, or if my intuition is telling me not to plan. Hear me out.

At the end of the day, the point of a plan is to achieve goals. A plan is a tool. Me? I‚Äôve never had an issue executing tasks or achieving goals. On the contrary, my problem in business is usually taking on too much and spending my days in overwhelm.

I‚Äôm tired of trying to do things the way that other people do them. 2024 is a year for me to get really fucking curious about my working style and test out new ways. Ways that might or might not work, but will teach me at the very least.

So I won‚Äôt be planning this year, at least not beyond the simple note listing my goals and a running to-do list. Instead, I‚Äôll be spending the majority of my working hours taking care of myself so that the work can flow like magic.

This looks like meditation, gym, beach and personal development during work time, and brief periods of intense focus to get through the actual work.

I‚Äôll be sure to let you know how it works out for me. I‚Äôm a multi-dimensional being attempting to undo every story I‚Äôve ever been told about success.
