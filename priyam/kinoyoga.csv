178568129,kinoyoga,CwpuEp0IDUT,True,"Which version of Upward Facing Dog is for you?

As many different yoga students there are, that is how many different ways there are to do the asana. There isn’t only one correct way. There are many ways that work for many different people.

Sometimes it’s helpful to make the pose more accessible. Sometimes it’s appropriate to make the pose more challenging. Sometimes it’s necessary to adapt for injuries or to give the body time. Sometimes it’s good to work the classical version really intensively. 

Find your way. Keep practicing 🙏

Sometimes our practice is about drawing our attention inward instead of splaying outward. Internal rotation of the hip joints can help balance the pelvis. Focusing the mind inward can help instill emotional and spiritual balance.

When you practice with @timfeldmannyoga and I, you will get the chance to dive into your personal practice and take away tips and techniques that are right for you. This video was filmed in beautiful Bali @radiantlyaliveyoga and we will be back next year for two weeks of practice. Come and practice with us in Bali and experience the magic of the practice and this special island paradise.

We hope you will join us for these special two weeks in Bali @radiantlyaliveyoga in March! Details are in my bio link and on our websites.

We will also be teaching together in Mallorca @balearicretreats and in Miami @miamilifecenter and for one week @yogainsalento — come practice 🚀

Gently shuffle around and see what happens. Sooner or later a path forward is bound to reveal itself. And when it does be ready to follow it.

We cannot wave a magic wand and make everything possible. But what we can do is cultivate an attitude of acceptance around what is. Maybe that’s the magic we are looking for anyway.

One day we will look back and realize that every mistake was a blessing, that every missed opportunity was actually another door opening and everything we resisted was there to guide us. It’s not that we aren’t faced with adversity. It’s not that we shouldn’t suffer. It’s that we are here to learn and each step carries its own wisdom, sometimes that wisdom comes from love and sometimes it comes from loss, but either way, we grow and evolve from the experience.

178568129,kinoyoga,C37qCAnPCuY,True,"Jump through, straight legs sit down. This is a phrase that you will hear over and over again and every single Ashtanga Yoga class. If you keep practicing, you may even hear this phrase in your dreams.

Learning to jump through holds so much information about inversions, strength, mental, focus, and surrender. You can’t rush the process of building the foundational strength in order to learn the lesson of jumping through. You can, however, focus on the step-by-step technique that will eventually lead you there. 

I remember when I first started practicing how frustrating it was that I couldn’t do this movement. Now, more than 20 years later, I still think there are many ways to refine the movement and get stronger. What’s important to me is not the performative aspect, but the connection of breath, awareness and mental focus. This is the essence of the flow that happens when our mind and body are completely harmonized.

Now I’m missing hearing my teacher tell us all to jump through as I unroll my mat on my own.

All of life can be a teacher if we attune ourselves to the teaching. Or, we can walk blindly by teachable moments handed to us on the path and lose a chance to grow and evolve. That lesson somehow always comes back and nothing that is ours is really ever lost. But it’s in the mind-stuff that the magic happens. 

By staying attentive towards the subtle signs that surround us, we can hear the unspoken wisdom of the ancients whispering in our ears, urging us to continue in their footsteps along the eternal road of awakening.

Both the intended and unintended consequences of our actions rest on our shoulders. I don’t see this a zero sum game of winners and losers or some harsh deity that issues judgement. Instead, every experience is all about learning, growing and evolving. 

An action we take with the best intentions reverberates for lifetimes with both positive and negative impact on our lives and the lives of those around us. We can be working through the residual impact for as long as need in order to integrate the spiritual lesson. Repetition isn’t always due to failure. Sometimes it’s about seeing another person or reaching a deeper layer. 

Once we are strong enough to see ourselves clearly, we are ready to really go through the process of spiritual awakening. Everything we do in three practice prepares us for increasingly deeper levels of self-realization. We can’t rush. We can only go at our own pace and trust that what is meant to happen will happen when it’s meant to happen.

And yet, there is something in the synergy of thought, emotion and action that tells a story of our beingness. Somehow the vibration of our spirit reverberates like an echo in all we do, leaving traces of truth like footprints in the sands of our life. 

The spiritual path teaches us how to listen to the echo of our own silence and read the disappearing letters written on the winds of time. What we learn along the way is not always easy, but sooner or later the seeds best their fruits of happiness, peace and love. Until there, we just have to stay on the path.

There is still so much unexplored in the realm of the mind. Yoga is a seeker’s path, for those who yearn to know and explore what lies beyond the horizon of the known.

Yoga cultivates a steady mind. Once we strengthen our capacity for focus and concentration, new possibilities open. There is a quiet space underneath our thoughts that we can only ever perceive with a calm and focused mind. The subtleties of our inner world will only reveal themselves to us when we are ready. We cannot force our way into the depths or fake access. We have to keep practicing and be patient. 

There are moments of emptiness that are actually full if we know how to experience them. There is a hidden structure amidst chaos. Eventually, the yogi’s mind can see the unseen truths behind the veneer of the world.
