On 14 October 1492, Christopher Columbus touched land after leaving Spain on the islands known as Guanahan√≠, today called the Bahamas. Taking slaves (he was a slave owner, too), two months later, on 5 December, he landed on the island of Taino. In a typical conquering manner, renaming it La Isla Espa√±ola, or The Spanish Island, later called Hispaniola. Today, Hispaniola is divided‚Äîthe Dominican Republic on the east and Haiti on the west.

Knowing the culture of the Caribbean well, for the @NatGeo story, The Culture of Sugar (read the first sugar caption in my IG), Haiti is unique‚Ä¶in Haitian Vodou, sugar is of spiritual importance.

Vodou came with slaves forced from central and western Africa to Haiti shortly after Columbus. This most special, beautifully unique form of spirituality is often misunderstood and interwoven in Haitian culture.

@RegineParicia, a specialist in Haitian culture, knew of a Rada lwa ceremony 30 km (about 20 mi) from Port-au-Prince. Traveling with filmmaker @AnkaVision (Anka was creating a NatGeo TV Amazing Photos documentary for this chapter on sugar), we were welcomed by the community of Dumilseau Village in La Plaine into rituals, healings, and trance like nowhere else on earth.

Why sugar and vodou?

Sugar is essential in Haitian Vodou‚Äìmany spirits require sweet, sugary substances.

Intricate patterns of religious symbols, called Veve‚Äôs, are created on the earth using flour, ground coffee, and offerings of sugar‚Ä¶sodas, and Barbancourt rum, made from sugarcane.

A table-like altar was created for the Cra Bi Nay Ceremony to honor the spirit Bossou, adorned with orange sodas, Coca-Cola, and candies.

Before a cow was sacrificed, many went into a trance, pouring sugary rum over their bodies and making offerings of sugar to the spirits. Others were healed with soda. Music was hypnotic, a reminder of the rhythms I heard as a child living in the Bahamas playing with my classmates at their homes, some of whom were of Haitian descent.

A short film in this album shares this beautiful intensity where sugar and spirituality merge.

7686242,johnstanmeyer,C2hpmi0LA8i,False,"Forgotten Story: The Culture of Sugar.

The history of sugar is bitter by dark moments of our human ego and desires for control.

For thousands of years, this sweetness was cultivated from the grass known as sugarcane, moving from Oceania by trade.

In colder climates of Europe where sugarcane would not grow, the demand for sugar during a time when such delights were rare, and spreading Colonization, the spice wars began in the 15th century for flavor-filled items like nutmeg, cinnamon, and yes, sugar. By the 18th century, most sugar was obtained from the West Indies.

During the Napoleonic Wars, sugar supplies were cut off by the English blockade of continental Europe.

To make up for this loss, Napoleon Bonaparte encouraged the growing of beets‚Ä¶in the 17th century, a German chemist discovered white and red beetroot contained sucrose, able to extract sugar.

After gaining a presence in France, the introduction of sugar beet production in the United States was first established, a short drive from where I live to North Hampton, MA‚Äîby 1883, ceasing operation.

It wasn‚Äôt until seeds arrived in North Dakota from Michigan in the late 1800s that sugar from beets became viable. With heavy labor done by German and Russian immigrants who moved to North Dakota for jobs, the surrounding areas of Fargo became the epicenter of sugar production in the United States.

In 1899, American Crystal Sugar was founded, and so began the most significant crop production of sugar beets in North America, along the Red River Valley in North Dakota.

From the @NatGeo story, The Culture of Sugar, which was never published (read why in the caption in my first post of this story), sharing with you the mesmerizing movement of how nearly all white processed sugar at American Crystal Sugar is produced for US consumption.

To understand the enormity of our desire for sweetness, the images inside the storage silo represent 35 million tonnes, or the equivalent of 7 million 2.3 kg (5 lb) bags of sugar.

A short film is in this album on the mysterious machines that create this sugar desire.

Once a rare spice, every genus of sugar originates east of the Wallace Line in Papua New Guinea.

Beginning in around 4 C.E., sugar moved from Oceania through trade often connected to conflict and slavery‚Ä¶at that time in history, nowhere else on earth had or grew sugar.

For the unpublished @NatGeo story, The Culture of Sugar, these crystals are culturally unimaginable in PNG culture.

Unaware of what to expect, my contact was Father Paul Kanda, a Papuan Catholic priest who told me, ‚ÄúJohn, just come, I will show you.‚Äù

After four days of travel by propeller plane and trucks to reach the highlands of Enga Province, there was a wedding.

Father Kanda drove us to a hillside where I met William Waikenda, a kamongo or tribal leader, preparing for the Yari ceremony in Wapai Village. He would lead the Yole Maingi (bride prize) ceremony in a few hours, uniting a woman and man before a Christian marriage.

Insects swarmed everywhere, drawn to the sweetness of sugarcane leaning against a tree.

Down the hill, I found the groom, 24-year-old Samuel Tembe, skipping along a pathway through a gorgeous landscape of greenness to meet his bride.

At a clearing in Wapai was 20-year-old Janet Sani and her family; Samuel took his place next to his future wife and immediately began the Yole Maingi (bride prize).

Why sugar?

Giving and eating raw sugarcane is essential; the bridge or conduit to unite two tribes creates harmony between the bride and groom‚Äôs tribes. A practice for thousands of years in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea.

When leaving, William Waikenda insisted I take three sugarcane sticks. Unkind to say no, confused about what to do with this long gift, I rested three canes out of the truck window, enjoying a few bites. Later, I gave Father Kanda the rest of the massive poles.

Sharing more stories of the fascination with sugar from Papua New Guinea in the coming days‚Ä¶. The Yole Maingi ceremony only touches the unimaginable sugar culture, the roots of this now common sweetener.

Also included is a short video.

A story that never was published due to changing writers (read the caption in the first photograph in this series, Forgotten Story); for more than a year, I created an essay for @NatGeo about how this common sweet substance has a captivating, often lengthy, dark global history.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
With India having the unpleasant recognition as the second highest rate of diabetes (China is first, both due to large populations) and wanting to return to my favorite spiritual city, Varanasi (Banaras, also known as Kashi), I did the usual movement of learning, while not knowing or expecting anything. Wandering the streets and alleys, getting lost.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
This was when I met Ram Ji, squatting like a guru upon a small wooden stool along Godowlia Street, cleaning teeth, making dentures, and catering to the dental needs of the poorest of the poor. He didn‚Äôt know his age, guessing at the time he was 85. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Known as Baba ji to his clients, he learned dentistry from his father and, since childhood, had been a roadside dentist, training more than 30 street dentists, including his son.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Spending three days together with a nonstop flow of customers, Ram ji attributed his busy practice to the high consumption of sugar, which is abundant in nearly all Indian foods, especially chai.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
In all the noise, dirt, and chaos on Godowlia Street, Ram ji miraculously kept his dental tools clean, though his finger hygiene was a bit questionable...there is a short video at the end of this story. 
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
Returning to Banaras a few years ago to give him equipment donated by dental friends, I learned from his son that Baba ji had passed away. A kindest man who gave so much to others, often for free.

Around midway through, I was introduced to a new writer, sharing what I had been creating. After a few months, this writer‚Äôs manuscript was also rejected.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
When the photography was completed ‚Äî Oceania, South and Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and the United States ‚Äî the magazine commissioned a third writer, Rich Cohen, author of Sweet and Low: A Family Story, a memoir about the creation of the artificial sweetener in the pink packet invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, Cohen‚Äôs grandfather.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
National Geographic accepted Rich‚Äôs manuscript, but this time, the text had nothing to do with the culture of sugar: the story focused more on the health issues of sugar, not a global narrative on the culture of sugar.
‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä
My good friend, @robertclarkphoto, was hired to photograph sugary foods in his studio, creating beautiful images to accompany Cohen‚Äôs text.

As always, we are offering a special workshop fee for early registration and even more discounts for those returning from our Workshop Family.

Complete details about this unimaginable event are at the link in my Instagram bio or by visiting stanmeyer.com
