Commonly found in deep waters, this fish inhabits reefs, and when frightened, will hide among rocks. Blackcap basslets are considered highly territorial and do not like to share space with other basslets or similar looking species. In the wild, they feed primarily on small invertebrates.

Once plentiful throughout their range, it is estimated that there are less than 100 mountain bongos remaining in Kenya as a result of over hunting. With the opening of the sanctuary in Meru County, locals vowed to never hunt the species for meat again, and stringent measures have been put in place to protect and multiply their numbers. Partners are hopeful that the arrival of 25 bongos to Kenya, sent from @rarespec Foundation’s breeding center in the US, will signify a brighter future for the species, bringing it back from the brink of extinction.

225429667,joelsartore,C37xtntu2cE,False,"Red-bellied squirrels like this one call southern China, Malaysia, and the mountains of Taiwan home. Like most squirrel species, they rely heavily on a diet rich with leaves, fruit, seeds, nuts, acorns, and even the occasional insect. To ensure that their bellies stay full all year long, these critters will actually adjust their diet to align with seasonal food availability. In winter, they’ll consume flowers from the camellia tree, then transition to a leaf-based meal plan from April to May. Come summer, fruits become the primary food source, and as the year comes to a close, they’ll pivot one last time, feasting on ants before they head underground.

This #InternationalPolarBearDay, become a polar bear protector by reducing the amount of electricity you use. Start by bundling up in extra layers instead of running your heater, or pledge to walk or use public transport instead of a personal vehicle whenever possible. Simple changes like these can do a lot to cut back on energy use, which helps to reduce carbon in the air and reduce global warming. Plus it saves you money! Photo taken @abqbiopark.

Found in Papua New Guinea, this species was found to have evolved with two other species from a single common ancestor 17 to 19 million years ago. This is an exciting discovery as it indicates that these turtles witnessed the full geological development of New Guinea, unlike other species which appear to have arrived after the island had fully formed.

Similar in size and appearance to a domestic cat, this species is endemic to northern Oman and parts of the United Arab Emirates. In this semi desert landscape, the Gordon’s wildcat spends its day sleeping, concealed in rock crevices, hollow trees, or empty fox burrows. At night, this cat emerges to hunt, feeding primarily on small rodents, birds, reptiles, and small insects. The Gordon’s wildcat is regarded as one of the most threatened subspecies of wildcat, largely due to loss of habitat for agricultural purposes and hybridization with feral, domestic cats.

While they may not be able to fly, these birds are quick on their feet; capable of running up to 40 miles per hour, outpacing impressive predators like lions, leopards, and hyenas. On the off chance a predator is able to catch them, ostriches will deliver a powerful kick in order to defend themselves. A single kick from an ostrich can be fatal, delivering up to 2,000 pounds of force per square inch - that’s twice as powerful as blows delivered by professional boxers!

225429667,joelsartore,C3p1LdeudxP,False,"Meet the scarlet kingsnake. If you’re thinking this serpent looks suspiciously like a coral snake, you’d be right. As a form of protection from potential predators, the non-venomous scarlet kingsnake exhibits mimetic coloration - meaning that it has an appearance that closely resembles the venomous coral snake in order to confuse any creature interested in causing the snake harm. While this works well as a form of predator aversion, it can backfire when it comes to interactions with humans, who will often kill scarlet kingsnakes after mistaking them for a venomous species. To help you correctly identify these snakes in the wild, remember this saying: “Red touches yellow, kill a fellow. Red touches black, friend of Jack.” Photo taken @zooknoxville
