For journalism, that works, but it leaves little room for more extreme artistic expression in post production. It‚Äôs taken me a long time to free my mind enough to explore that other side, which seems strange to me now as I write that because I consider myself a pretty creative and out of the box thinker. I guess that I‚Äôve been so focused on the perfect/real photo that I never let myself think about what a photo could be if I completely break free of those chains. So I‚Äôve been playing around with more extreme photoshop editing on a couple of images to see where it takes me, and it‚Äôs been really fun and freeing. I‚Äôd never call these real photos, but they are based on actual images I‚Äôve taken (I‚Äôve included both the edited and unedited images in two examples).

It‚Äôs tough to watch any animal die. Our human instinct is to look away and feel a sense of shame/guilt for even wanting the hunt to happen in the first place. It‚Äôs a normal and perfectly fine reaction. But life in the Maasai Mara is not easy, and lions must kill to survive. We‚Äôve lost over 90% of the lion population in the last 50+ years. Lions are in serious trouble, and I can‚Äôt imagine a world in which we can‚Äôt see them in the wild. So I try to bear witness, without wishing a kill to happen but also not looking away when it does.

On this particular morning, these two male lions ambushed a rather large herd of buffalo, and managed to separate this one from the group. It was over rather quickly, as these two brothers are expert hunters and together there‚Äôs not much that they can‚Äôt take down. That‚Äôs more than I can say for other kills I‚Äôve witnessed. 

Such is the tug and pull (figuratively, and in this case, quite literally too) of life on the Mara. #kenya #safari",4,420,1706216664,"{'id': '603921465', 'has_public_page': True, 'name': 'Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya', 'slug': 'maasai-mara-national-reserve-kenya'}",https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/421692146_18407398030053358_6722798285985063490_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=110&_nc_ohc=0P1kI32HnjQAX80HJFK&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfB424-e0ubnfY7tMbNe572ON2C92XLLiDU6651WNqtl9g&oe=65E972CB&_nc_sid=8b3546,False

Image 1: Avenue des Baobabs in western Madagascar. I had always wanted to visit this iconic place, and it was indeed magical. Pro tip: sunrise, not sunset, is the best time to be there!

Image 2: Whale Sharks of Kaimana, Indonesia. Once again, a bucket list experience that came true in 2023. Pro tip: skip the snorkel and go diving with whale sharks for a more intimate experience with these gentle giants. 

Image 3: Kung Fu Lemur, Anjajavy, Madagascar. Verreaux‚Äôs Sifaka lemurs are known for dancing across the ground as they make their way between trees. Pro tip: get super low to the ground (belly to the dirt) to photograph the ballerina-like moves of this funny lemur. 

Image 4: Wilson‚Äôs Bird-of-Paradise, West Papua Indonesia. Seeing this incredibly colorful bird in the wild was a dream! Pro tip: use a super fast aperture lens (at least f/2.8) as you‚Äôll be shooting in  the low light forest at dawn to see this bird. 

Image 5: Ladybugs in my backyard, Golden Colorado. My wife bought ladybugs for our garden and I had just started experimenting with a good macro setup. This is the first image I took with a macro lens that I am proud of. My interest in macro photography has only grown since then! Pro tip: in addition to a good macro lens, get a really good light diffuser that surrounds your lens to illuminate the subject, as macro is often shot at higher number apertures in low light.

Madagascar is filled with all kinds of fascinating creatures big and small, such as this satanic leaf-tailed gecko (Uroplatus phantasticus). Yes, that is its real name, and it does look a bit devilish, I must admit. However, when I first heard its full Latin name I almost keeled over in laughter. How could something be named ‚Äúsatanic‚Äù and at the same time have a Latin name that sounds like ‚Äúfantasticus‚Äù? From that point on, and forever more, this little guy will be named Mr Fantasticus to me. It sounds like a superhero name‚Ä¶.perhaps the next @marvel hero? 

Unfortunately, Mr Fantasticus is being captured (even within conservation areas) and sold to the international pet trade at alarming rates. Couple that with deforestation and loss of its natural habitat and the outlook is grim. Continued conservation is needed to protect and save Mr Fantasticus. üôè

The most conspicuous feature of the ring-tailed lemur is its long tail that is adorned with 26 black and white alternating rings, the first of which is always white and the last one (the tip of the tail) is always black. The tail is used for balance and communication, not for grabbing (it is not prehensile). 

The ring-tailed #lemur is both endemic to #Madagascar and endangered, facing the loss of their forest habitat as a result of stock overgrazing, field burning/clearing, as well as tree-cutting for making charcoal.
