4572481,jaredwhitney,CzClKIZv798,False,"Hello everyone! Wanted to share a life update with you.

Two years ago, I embarked on a journey to shift my main focus from photography and media to the world of Real Estate. In that relatively short span, I've had the incredible privilege of assisting numerous families in their home buying and selling journeys. It's been an absolute blast!

However, it hasn't been without its challenges. Being fairly new in my real estate career, I have navigated the complexities of business partnerships, and ultimately contended with the turbulent state of the housing market. With the ups and downs of this last season, I have learned that what is most important is having stability and consistency for my family. With that, my primary focus of business going forward won't be centered around Real Estate for the foreseeable future.. While I'm still a licensed Real Estate Broker in Oregon and ready to assist with buying and listing, my social media efforts are going back to where my heart truly lies - photography and other creative pursuits.

Photography has never truly left the scene. As a matter of fact, I'm currently consulting and planning a host of exciting commissioned projects with some remarkable clients, and I can't wait to share these ventures with you. The time has come to officially ""pivot"" my content back to what I've cherished and adored for over a decade: capturing and narrating incredible stories of people, families, businesses, and causes. 

If you'd like to see more of my work, please follow along here and check out my website through the link in my bio!
