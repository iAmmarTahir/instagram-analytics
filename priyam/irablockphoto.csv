I was a little surprised when I saw a group of little girls at the bar learning how to make their ‘famous’ drink. I shot some images first and asked questions later. The girls were making alcohol free drinks, of course. The young lady with the pacifier in her mouth eventually removed it to try her alcohol free drink 
I am sure that Ernest Hemingway, who lived near by and was inspired to write the Old Man and the Sea based on the local fishermen would have approved of the girls early training.
