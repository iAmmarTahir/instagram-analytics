From my @smithsonianmagazine story following the orca and herring migration in the polar night of Norway with @arctic_freediving.

I had the pleasure of sharing this story and more about water,  land  and action to students this week @coastfilmfestival. 

Good to see you @stacyabare - thanks for your voice for wild people,  places and service.

It blew my mind. 

The second image by @loralohara shows the entire Grand Canyon in all its eroded wonders in one single frame. It amazes me to think that it took me 71 days on foot to walk the length of that natural wonder, but the space station crosses it in seconds.
