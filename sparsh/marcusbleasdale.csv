BACKGROUND for the conflict:⁠
Since the 1990s, The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has experienced a decades-long war that has roots in a struggle for power. The complex conflict followed the end of colonialism and the eruption of independence in DRC in the 1960s. Mining has played a large role in supplying finance to several rebel groups operating in DRC, causing gross damage, millions of deaths, and displacements of the people living here.⁠
⁠
Please DONATE to CKI: ⁠
Congo Kids Initiative (CKI) is specifically for children who have lost their parents and communities to the conflict. St. Kizito is a facility located in the town of Bunia at the site of some of the most extreme violence. They work with local partners that determine targets of how these children can be provided with the most loving, sustainable, and nurturing environment. Donations can help CKI to provide early-childhood and primary education, medical care, and resources for the children to reintegrate with family and society to live more independent lives long-term. ⁠
