183810550,omgdeedee,C4EKMmcS7St,False,"Kitten pic, don't freak out, it just means I'm missing my boy. Not much to report today, but the doctor said that she's increasing fluids today to hopefully get him rehydrated faster. Good news is that he ate like a pig last night, and then again pretty well this morning. He still needs to get to internal medicine for the additional tests and ultrasound, but on weekends they can only accommodate the 2 worst cases and he's not one of them so that's ok with me. Tomorrow is when I believe I'll learn if they're are any underlying issues other than the kidneys, and we're just hoping that it's something treatable. We can't wait to have him home.

183810550,omgdeedee,C4Bon0mx-Sr,False,"I took Gary to UCD at around 6 this morning (estimate in 2nd pic) and the first thing they did was blood and urine tests. His kidney numbers are elevated (I don't have the exact numbers yet) and he's 8% dehydrated. Not sure what that means exactly, but they did hospitalize him and are slowly hydrating him to prevent and water accumulation in his lungs. They also want to check for thyroid issues, and he needs X-rays and an ultrasound to see if anything else is wrong as his kidney numbers to not indicate acute kidney failure. I want to thank you all for your support and donations as I would have had to wait for his regular vet and he would have been much worse off by Tuesday. I'm still looking at a high of around $4,000 but in my experience at UCD it doesn't usually get there I hope? He will not be home before Monday. I will hear from the doctor tomorrow morning at the earliest and will update again when I do.

His last kidney numbers weren't great and weren't too bad, but his deterioration seems like he needs some treatment. I have an appointment Tuesday, but if they can't fit him in before then I'd like to take him to Davis by tomorrow. I don't want to say it's an emergency situation but sooner is better.
