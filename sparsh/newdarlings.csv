6282156,newdarlings,CrbEs4GgzZ_,True,"A little monday morning motivation. I loved this sound clip when I heard it. We can apply it to so many things…asking for help as a parent, going after what you want in your career or diving deeper in your relationship. Taking that step to move forward and get out of a rut… the list can go and on. I think we’ve all have had trouble with doing one or all of these things at some point in our lives.
✨
With each step forward or heck, within any moment of self doubt, I find myself reflecting on the last year, or five years or ten years and realizing how much growth I’ve experienced as an individual. It can be hard for many of us to see it at times, but if we look, it’s there. 

Rob and I were just talking about this the other night after we put our 3 year old to bed. 3 year old?! Wait…almost 4 year old…what?!? We’re coming up on 10 years of marriage and never did we think we’d be in Arizona with a toddler, build a house or have traveled to all the places we have. None of this was the plan ten years ago sitting on a beach during our honeymoon. There never really was a plan, but every step we took, it felt like a step towards a more authentic self. A step towards a happier, more flexible life, creating space to explore and love and learn and stumble unapologetically. We created that space for ourselves together as a couple and still continue to grow and learn. Now we get to create that as parents together for a special little human who makes us feel more than we ever thought we could. 
🧡
This is turning into a novel and I’m writing this out at night (to post in the morning) which is probably why i feel all the feels…but all this to say, I love these words and I think it’s the encouragement we need to remind ourselves and our loved ones to go after what we want …create the type of life that brings our souls that much closer to feeling full. 🙌

You all already know we’re a shoes off kind of house (guys-just tell your friends to take their shoes off…it’s ok!!! 🤗😆🤪👟🥿🥾) so it was really important to us that whichever flooring we used not only looked good but also *felt* good under our feet. I’m so in love with  @stugastudio floors in their Fika option. Here are a few reasons why it was the right choice for us:

-they don’t use any toxic chemicals or solvents so I could have peace of mind with our little guy playing on the floors…🧡

-made from responsibly sourced, renewable materials💫

-#stugafika has wide-planks and a soft blonde tone that brightens up the oak’s natural color. It feels warm and rustic, but still fresh and modern, which was definitely the vibe we were going for.

-can be refinished twice, if you ever change your mind on the finish color 🙌

What do you guys think?

6282156,newdarlings,C3vZ82gvkGH,True,"Slowing down has been essential in my wellness journey. As we embrace these last few moments of winter, let’s try to soak it all in, not count down the days till spring time. I used to be angry at myself for wanting to slow down. I used to struggle with the change in seasons, but I’ve recently embraced how healing seasonality could be if we embrace it. The Earth, the animals, and plants are resting in winter, we should be too. We are more in sync with the Earth than we think. 

Moving slowly, embracing the season, and allowing ourselves to rest. Why is this something we so often fight when it’s what our bodies need the most? 
.
The sun is shining today, but we had a series of rainy days here in Tucson recently and the cloudy, cozy days gave me the nudge I needed to rest and recharge. After chatting with a few of you, it seems I’m not alone in needing to make that *conscious decision* to slow down.

When your toddler reads about the Seattle gum wall and becomes enamored with the idea, you need to book a trip to Seattle…and that’s exactly what we did. 

We used to visit Seattle all the time back in the day and it was so fun getting to show him some favorite places we visited years ago, thanks to the points we earned on our @Hilton Honors @americanexpress Surpass®
Card. We stayed just steps from the market and made it all over the city. It was so chilly but the perfect change of scenery and we had the best time. Traveling with kids is always an adventure, on so many levels, but these experiences are
beyond priceless!

6282156,newdarlings,C3f4Gf7PMup,True,"Simplicity, slowing down and creating intimate moments at home. Looking back it’s the quieter days that hold the most special memories with my family vs the big parties or grand trips. 

Many of us have our days filled with appointments, time to get from here to there, pick up this and that… we end up yearning for those slower moments but then are also programmed to think and feel it’s “boring” if we’re not constantly on the move. 🤔 

Why not make those times at home beautiful? Turn ordinary moments into extraordinary…just by switching our mind set…just by looking a little deeper and enjoying the beauty in the simplicity. 

I remember one summer as a kid, the AC went out for a good portion of the season. It was hot and humid (back east where I grew up.) My mom hung pretty sheets in the hallway to direct the airflow of the portable fan we had plugged in. My sisters and I gathered around with snacks and movies. I still remember the shadows dancing in our room, as we lowered the curtains to keep the heat from the sun out a bit. It felt magical and special, even though yes, we were hot…but we weren’t  focused on that at the time…

It’s easy to romanticize everyday moments if we let ourselves see things that way….a little more childlike, find some beauty and magic in it all…

It takes a while to make a house a home…to find pieces that feel like you. I’m all for mixing and matching new with vintage.

Most of my DMs are about where I found certain home items: vases, bowls, hooks, etc…Here are a few of my favorite home decor pieces we used in our house build, along with a few similar ones that are pretty close to some vintage finds I love.
