You can now see the video of me and some of my philosophy for photography on @nikoneurope Youtube channel. I was one of nine creators, who embarked on a bus trip from Malaga to Valencia in search of the perfect shot the new Z 8 mirrorless camera.
Packing a host of Z 9 features into a lightweight body, the all-new Z 8 gives image-makers an astounding flexibility to bring our vision to life! 
With its impressive blend of class-leading performance and compact build, this camera is an exciting follow up to the Z 9 and the creative successor to the D850. The Z 8 is a video and stills powerhouse, with key new features such as an in-camera 12-bit RAW for video up to 8.3K/60p or 4.1K/120p, and an array of file sizes and burst speeds for still shooters. 
This is the perfect hybrid camera for creators who want a lighter body for shooting handheld or a full-frame camera that will balance perfectly on any rig, including most gimbals. 
I can't wait for you all to be able to experience this camera and its impressive new features for yourselves!
