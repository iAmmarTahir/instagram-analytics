4 days out and I feel like my familiar healthy self again. She had been missing for quite some time.

💕Eye and face puffiness is totally gone
💕6 lbs of inflammation GONE
💕 ZERO joint or neck pain anymore.
💕Rash is GONE
💕Focus and energy is great 
💕I’ve flipped a switch. I’m happy for the DDs to be gone and I’m looking forward to my new top half (or lack there of 🤣)

My right breast is in a lot of pain still but that’s to be expected with the amount of muscle repair

If you swipe you’ll see that I’m prob not even an A cup now. I am back to factory settings.

Next picture is the difference in my eyes two hours before surgery and the morning after surgery 

The final picture was my implant rupture. I had the mentor gummy bear ones (the kind not supposed to rupture 😏)

You all have been AMAZING. I’ve read ALLLLL of your comments and messages and I appreciate you more than words can express. My experience of women is there are way more women that lift others up than tear them down. Your community, love and support has made my healing next level. 

What I’m doing to continue to heal?

✅Daily hyper baric oxygen chamber 
✅Red light therapy 
✅I’ll start infrared sauna in 4 weeks 
✅light walks for now- workouts after 4-6 weeks once I’m cleared 
✅Full detox protocal to get rid of the heavy metals and chemicals that showed up in my toxin report from the rupture 
✅Eating very clean and healthy. Following my 7 day jump start (type JUMP START below and check your inbox if you want the plan)

My husband- @life_of_brooksie I won the lottery marrying you. You have been so incredibly supportive. 

Oh and my surgeon? @drrichardjbrown you are the REAL DEAL. Thanks for caring so much and for treating me with the best care possible. I’m so grateful to have found you.

Next- BC I know you will ask haha this in the video is a @powerplateusa and YES I have a link and discount for you too for this in the guide. And NO we don’t keep it out by the pool haha and I don’t suggest that. Buuuuut it was more motivating for me to workout outside and it makes for a better video so my husband got the lucky opportunity to carry it outside for me and set up an extension cord 🤣 He was thrilled 

Why am I using it? The vibration from the plate helps with balance, lymphatic drainage,muscle development and really forces you to work your core. You get 30-50 muscle contractions PER SECOND by using this! It’s a total fast track to fitness

I retrained  myself once already after my bicep tear but this explant and muscle repair was a whole thing. So, I am fully starting over.

Asked a few post ago if you’d want to learn too and many of you chimed in YES so let’s do this together?

Step ONE: Hollow hang. HANG onto a bar BUT, create a tight core (slight L) like I’m doing here to train your core muscles as well

Hold for up to 10 seconds and then repeat 3 times. If you can only hold 1-2 seconds that is fine too! Do what you can 

Repeat this 4 times this week mimimim. 

If I can do this at age 52 post torn bicep (at the distal repair) and total explant, capsulectomy and chest wall repair YOU CAN TOO

“What’s wrong with your eyebrows?”
“You have bad Botox”

I’m 52 years old and my forehead moves and so do my brows with my many expressions. That’s what foreheads do without Botox 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️

I do not do Botox.
I HAVE in the past tried it and hated it (on me). One time a doctor did a great job with it and it lasted a whole week. That was it. My strong brows forced it out 🤣🤣🤣

I get that some of you  love it - if I loved it I’d do it too 🤷🏻‍♀️

But for me- I like my expressions. I feel weird when they go away and because I have very expressive eyebrows , it makes me not feel like me.

The funny thing is that because it’s so common to get it, people assume that bc my brows and forehead are so expressive that I just have “bad Botox” and love to tell me this 

Anyways- the second part of this video is a filter - but that’s what I felt Botox made me look like 😠

46424148,nataliejillfit,C3vfW_HPj5Y,False,"Almost 11 weeks post explant and here is what I’ve learned about myself:

💗 I put them in at age 19 bc I didn’t feel good  about myself. I was self conscious THEN about being “flat” and that has not gone away. I had implants for 33 years and being a double DD became part of my identity. It feels stupid to admit that now but is true. Removing them has been more than a health thing. It’s been a deep dive into my own psychology and looking at why I felt I “needed them”

💗 I feel stronger than ever. PHYSICALLY. I’m grateful to have learned about the rupture as it’s amazing how many things in my body have normalized since they are out. My body is happier without them 

💗When I first removed them, I ordered a bunch of padded sports bras and bras.I wear NONE of the padded things now. I’m embracing the flat. I don’t care if “others” think it looks better not to- I’m done pretending to be something I’m not in my body.  I’m not even an A cup and it’s my way of apologizing to 19 year old me. I’m going to love and accept her  now the way she is.

💗I do notice big boooobs everywhere now. And YES I mourn mine some days. But more often than not, I’m grateful to have removed them and am embracing my new body. I do not regret explanting.

💗 It was not just the explant that healed me. I’ve done a LOT of deep gut work this last year and left a house that was covered with mold. So it was a combination. 

💗I used to think people that talked about BII were cray cray- now I think I was the crazy one. Why did I dismiss the possibility that implants could be harming me for so long 🙈 sooooo many people tried to tell me. I used to get triggered by that. 

💗 Alllllll my inflammation is GONE. So is my pain, my excess weight, my energy dips. I’m back to my familiar self.

Anyways- Hadn’t shared about my post explant thoughts in a while so thought I would!
