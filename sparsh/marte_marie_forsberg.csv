It’s sunshine and 20 degrees, and the strawberries in the garden are ripening, or it’s partly cloudy and almost 6 degree, at least when the sun peeks through, and I’ve been pruning back the rose bushes. It’s the sort of beginning that makes me feel like I’m right there next to her. So today, with the surprise sprinkling of big fluffy white snowflakes, and plummeting temperatures, I updated her on the weather first thing as I called her this morning to hear her heartbeat next to mine. I held my daughter’s hand as she rested on my chest next to the furry four legged Mr Whiskey, who was not at all eager to start the day. I had buttermilk pancakes on the agenda, a beautiful bi product of all the homemade butter I made yesterday, but all she wanted was morning snuggles, so we just rested, with hands and paws entwined, and my mother on the line. We talked about the weeks ahead, and I listed all the delicious everyday treats I’d make with the emerging wild garlic I spotted last week on a drive around my old neighbourhood in Tisbury. Wild garlic pesto, pickled wild garlic flowers that I’d serve with baked trout, and wild garlic scones etc, you get the picture. It was time to throw on our coats and tighten the scarf, as we walked to school in the gloomy weather. Will you send me a picture of Spring, my mother asked as we said our goodbyes and I love yous, on the phone. So here it is, a little reminder that behind a grey cloud there is always sunshine, and after snow on the first day of March, Spring is imminent, and that’s something to take comfort in on this very day. If you want to join me this spring for a food photography workshop, send me a DM and I’ll pop more information over to you. And speaking of Spring, I cannot wait for my end of March fully immersion photography workshop in Florence! And if you’re waiting for the next newsletter, hang in there, it’s on its way;) xx",14,795,1709286724,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/430464764_1727949941065863_8422383632504325917_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=EA5k-fp3JdEAX-18frJ&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDxImtSGXtayik4SpLR3zQ6X2N546rT4quQu1JqP8Dcng&oe=65EA8323&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C38b-OOMuzo,False,"I could fill books on the topic of why I love living in England so much, but one of them is being able to bring in baskets of evergreens, wilted bracken, and blossoming flowers in November and February and June alike. Growing up in Norway the white winters were beautiful and definitely had its magical moments, but I love going for winter walks amongst evergreens and flowering snow drops in January while my mother tells me on the phone it’s yet another day of ice and -20 at the fjord island my parents live. I could fill baskets on end with flowering gorse, ivy, holly and bare winter branches with a few brown wilted leaves. Although flowers are beautiful, give me a branch with or without green leaves any day. So our little cottage, my garden studio and car are always filled with evidence of my never ending love for nature, bringing the outside in. It simply brings joy, the everyday kind, that cost nothing, but truly makes all the difference. Which brings me back to yesterday’s launch of my new ongoing stillife series, of wilted leaves and twisted twigs, a homage to the muted tones of the wilted botanical world of the English countryside. #myenglishcountryside",4,395,1709237460,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/430640657_904378038003640_2786815228534579427_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=104&_nc_ohc=1osR5RL12fAAX9a0nd8&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCfq0xvhKevCWI2zk5V7OD_2iXNCrNzpUOlfec3-KIhkQ&oe=65EA4F8E&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C35bcoVsTu1,False,"With a birthday breakfast tray in bed, feet wrapped around a hot water bottle, staying warm in the early morning chill, I re-read a book; “Constance Spry the Fashion for Flowers” by the brilliant @shaneconnollyandco , bought on a visit to the @gardenmuseum a few summers back during their Constance Spey exhibition. Like so many, I’m enthralled by her work, and was beyond delighted when I uncovered her cookbook, in a dusty pile of used books in a cardboard box, in a local antique bookshop. She was such a multi faceted and very ahead of her time, woman. She’s often on my mind when I create my floral stillifes. Last year I began a series inspired by old yellowed tear sheets of botanical prints, gathering leaves, insects, cones and seeds, creating these quiet flat lays in my studio. Those who know me well, smile at me as I duck underneath fences s d leap across the street to catch just the right wilted leaf that has caught my eye. I wedge a few in between handwritten pages in my journal, but most end up in glass jars that I keep in my studio. Gnarly, twisted, wilted, and broken, I love me a good leaf with just the right curve or stem. I haven’t show these more muted stillifes of mine till today, but since this is my birthday and the beginning of something new, I’ll start sharing this ongoing series of leaves, twigs and insects, as visual musings of the botanical world if you will. If you like them, there’s a couple available as limited edition prints on my website now.

2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C3zrqpqsy5V,False,"The sun peeked through every now and then this morning, and it felt like a warm hug. It was needed, it’s been raining for what feels like weeks on end, and although I don’t mind a drizzle or soaking, I turned my face towards the sun like moth to the flame. It’s the first day of the week, and although my birthday isn’t until Wednesday, I’m calling it my birthday week, and will unashamedly celebrate with little sprinkles of happiness every day of this week. Between a mug of tea at my daughter’s morning school assembly, and a well brewed coffee from the brilliant @bean_shot_coffee in town I stood on a street corner, when someone shook their head, and stopped themselves from saying what was on their mind and said: “It doesn’t matter”…and walked away. And I thought to myself, everything matters! Every moment of every day matters, everything we have in our hearts that we want to say, matters, the time we spend with someone else matters, we all matter, and life is way too short and way too long to not do, say or be, what we know in our hearts matter to us. I stood there in a small patch of sunlight, re-listening to those very words in my head. It’s the words of giving up on what matters, and it reminded me to always lean in, showing up, and daring to say what matters to me. It reminded me of being brave and standing tall amidst hardship, and about never losing sight of what’s important in life. I walked away with a reminder to live more, which brings me back to birthdays, a day I rarely if ever celebrate, feeling a bit silly about it all, and that it didn’t matter. Well, this is a new year, and if there ever was a time for change, it is now. So, a birthday week it is, with daily sprinkles of joy to celebrate another year around the sun, and that at the end of the day it can only rain for so long, before the sun finally comes out again;)",52,1226,1708943699,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/429981714_2574196719425913_3703598352756142673_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=Nkj0iIdxxz8AX-1M4zW&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBBo-nEBB7S88jX3h-U6PNNNdp8wW2oO1rabxGjvIrleQ&oe=65EB4147&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C3rzn0UsMeG,False,"The daffodils, the crocuses, the dandelions, primroses and daisies, are all blossoming around my little cottage. It feels a bit early but is a welcoming sight. I put the kettle on last night to fill my granny style hot water bottle with. The cool air sent a draughty chill sweeping across the 350 year old flagstone floor but the view of the sunny coloured daffodils in our cottage garden warmed, if only visually. Our garden has a long way to go, but let’s just say it’s filled with potential, scattered with a few flowers planted by the previous owner that tells me there’s hope for even the smallest of plots. I wrapped my feet around the hot water bottle while editing images for the recent client shoot in Norway. It was a day of ticking off items on the to-do list, but by early afternoon I had skimmed the top of the list, and called it a day, Mr Whiskey agreed. We strolled down high street in our little countryside village, past the weekly food market and towards the green rolling hills in the distance. I inhaled the emerging Spring freshness with flared nostrils. It’s a season of change, and I could feel it in the air. If you want to join me this Spring I have one spot left for the fully immersive Photography workshop in Florence at the end of March and a couple spots left for my food photography workshop here in the English countryside in May.

It’s will create the foundation for what’s to come, and there’s so much to come, so much to look forward to and so much to celebrate. The landscape around where we live may be a bit bleak  at the moment, but soon, oh so soon, the many colours of English countryside will return. Travels for work took be back to Norway these last couple of weeks. It’s was beautiful and in between shoots for clients in was a warming amount of time with family. It was needed and so welcomed. But then the last day of our trip came, and I yearned to return to my little cottage in the country. The daffodils were out as we drove home and a few trees were dressed in an eager coat of spring blossoms. We may have fallen asleep utterly exhausted after a day of connecting flights, lost luggage and passport issues, but when we opened the bedroom window to let the warm midnight air in, we feel asleep with a smile on our face…we were home, and nothing could dampen that feeling of peace and joy. #myenglishcountryside #england #home",8,585,1708514219,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/429331155_339543468519847_1660691852412726645_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=107&_nc_ohc=M3To4DFBeVgAX_dEP6m&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAr3cW5OmSf7LXQ7DISzofokWo5R70VfvlFUCRoerYvmQ&oe=65EAD36C&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C3Nahr8M3lo,False,"And then there is this woman, my mother. Today is Mother’s Day in Norway, a date I only remember because my sister reminds me, but I somehow always remember the date for it here in England. But no matter the date, this woman needs to be celebrated. She’s simply my heart, my beating heart, and hearing her say it will all be well, is all the assurance I need to keep going when times are hard. She so incredibly warm you simply cannot sit next to her without feeling uplifted. Her wisdom has carried me through everything life has to offer, and now to see my daughter lean on her for comfort, for love, for consistency in friendship, and for stability, when her young life is facing more challenges her age should need to carry on her shoulders, is so beautiful to watch. My mother brings joy and laughter that is infectious, and she has this beautiful way of laughing at herself which brightens any room she enters. I know I’m lucky, but I also know it’s hard work, because every time I tell her about people who comment on how lucky I am to have her, she smiles and simply tells me it’s a choice she makes every morning when she gets up, to be the best she can be, and it’s work, it’s a consistent choice. I try to mirror her ability to love during hardship and to never give up. And when I fall asleep at night next to my wonderful little girl, I count myself lucky to have them both in my life, and do my best in becoming for my daughter, what my mother is to me, a rock of love to lean on and to unwaveringly be encouraged to reach any goal and dream I may have.

Join us this May the 13-15th for a fully packet two day food photography workshop based at my dear friends at @ash_farm_dorset with individual accommodation in shepherds huts and small cabins, you wake up with sweeping views of green rolling hills in the heart of the English countryside. Two days of sharing all I know about food photography, where it all began really, how to style and create compelling food stories, with open fire cooking with @flamesandfeasts to local vineyard visits to learn the art of telling visual stories around food, weather you’re starting a journey as a food photographer, want to hone your skills, or learn to photograph for your own website. There’ll be hands on sessions on light, composition, storytelling, the use of props, styling, colour, editing and putting it all together to create complete stories. We only have a limited number available, with only four spots left. If you’re looking to bring a spouse, or you want to share accommodation with a friend please DM me and we’ll set it up for you. Email at marie@mmforsberg, me or DM and I’ll send the details over for you to book your spot.

2850364,marte_marie_forsberg,C2wmSWVsnqv,False,"It’s that kind of day where the clouds hang low on the horizon and the chance of sun is less likely than finding a pair of socks after they have entered the washing machine. The sky is a giant light box, and if I was in my studio today it would’ve given me that soft milky light that I so often yearn for when creating my stillifes. There’s something about a bit of gentle light descending on a little set up of flowers or a handful of fruit from the local market. I remember this day well, getting up early and walking through a sleepy southern town in Italy to the food market. I filled my basket and returned back to where we were staying eager to begin creating. All I needed was a sliver of light descending over the scene like the caress of a feather, and so I cracked the big old oak door to a room without any windows, and let my stillife be illuminated by that slight ray of warm Italian light. There’s magic in every type of light, it’s all about using it to your advantage and learn to see what it can help create for you. Harsh contrasty midday sunshine holds just as much magic in it as a sliver of soft lighting on a cloudy day. It’s all about working with what you’ve got and all my stillifes are created in very different light situations and locations, from caves in the south of Italy, to wonky old sheds with no window in the English countryside, to my sitting room bookshelves and on top of the nightstand in my cottage bedroom. A stormy day can offer up such wild and beautiful light, but so can a summers day at noon when the sun is in zenith. On my recent photography workshop in Florence we began the first day with the pursuit of light, learning to discover and recognise the power of natural light throughout the city, from artists studios, to alleyways, big old palazzo door openings and the incredible light reflecting off of the river Arno on a sunny day and big marble sculptures and surfaces. Light is truly where it all begins and ends for me in photography, and the more you hone your eye, the more you begin to see opportunities around every bend, like spotting your favourite colour everywhere.

On these smaller grouped workshops, only five participants, I share everything I know from light, composition, visual storytelling, settings, clients work, building a portfolio, fees, specks, books, editorial work, and editing. Because the group is so small, I’ll be able to meet you where you are on your photography journey, from complete beginners, to professionals that want to shake things up, after years in the industry. These workshops have become my favourite kind, and the photography mentoring continues on after we all go home on our last day, should you wish. Pop over to my website for more information. Should you want a private course in Florence, with a one on one bespoke workshop tailored to your needs, I have availability between the 25th of March to the 15th of April. Just pop me a message, and we can take it from there. I’m so looking forward to this year with workshops, client work that make me stretch, and to shape my weekly “The Photography Workshop” newsletter into something more complete. Like a friend reminded me a few days ago, this year has eleven more months of opportunities that we can fill with anything we want! And even if I haven’t written down any New Year’s resolutions other than continuing what I promised myself I’d work on last year, I’ve made one big commitment to myself this year, to only fill these next months with uplifting people who have values and and principles in life, and lead a life, that inspire me to do better, and to be better, and to always find time to be there for whoever may need it.

I want my photography newsletter to be able to serve you better and feel rich in relevance, but also filled with unexpected way for you to learn about the use of colour, light, storytelling, etc from people I admire in the creative industry who might have a completely different approach than a photographer would.
