We hiked, backpacked, road tripped, and floated rivers with her. At first, we carried her, and then we watched her walking for miles on her own while backpacking. She also learned rock climbing, fishing, biking, paddle boarding, and recently skiing. It‚Äôs so rewarding and special to watch your child grow and learn new skills. Most importantly, we created special memories as a family.
True wealth is not measured by how many things you own or how much money you have, but by the memories you‚Äôve collected. And in this we consider ourselves wealthy. #familyadventures #adventuringwithkids #hikingwithkids #travelingwithkids #familytravel",60,4071,1709411261,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/430957138_949395183470718_2434394737741454058_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=dYbqskks_g8AX8hIAey&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCZEQD2D3VNYE3rCGsfKF3aNG2RvxzyD7FtjQJCjWGJKg&oe=65E6F162&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
