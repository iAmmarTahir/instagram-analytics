1187715018,parisbyvegan,B7_fOr4pAYH,False,"CREPES RECIPE!!! 🥞👨‍🍳🧑‍🍳Next Sunday is chandeleur in France 🇫🇷 meaning we’re gonna stuff ourselves with crepes all day long!! 😃These delicious crepes are filled with fried apples and bananas, coconut yogurt blended with blueberries, coconut caramel… Heaven!! 😋
So the crepe recipe is SUPER SIMPLE, 🤟I’ve been making it since forever, it’s my go-to basic and I love that it has 5 ingredients only, 👍 you know when a recipe says it’s super simple and the ingredients are beyond 6 or 7 you should definitely have your doubts hehe! 🧐 So no fancy flour, or exotic ingredients, or whatever here!!! Na-aaahhh! 😝 Just the basic that anyone has in the pantry. Also gotta say that : the first crepe you’ll make is always a flop, well at least this always happens with me! 🤷‍♀️ Who else has this problem??? 🤪 So don’t stop right there, make another one, everything will be fine! 🙌 Enjoy!!
✨
Ingredients
* 1 cup soymilk (or plant milk of your choice)
* 1 cup flour (can be a GF flour too)
* 3 tbsp cane sugar
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tbsp coconut oil, melted
✨
Method
1. Put your flour in a bowl and form a well in the middle
2. Add cane sugar, melted coconut oil and baking powder
3. Whisk together adding the plantmilk little by little. Batter consistency should be very slightly thick
4. Heat a non-stick pan at medium heat, lightly oiled. Add a ladle and distribute evenly, to form a nice circle wait till it’s cooked (about 1 minute) and flip back on the other side. Allow the crepe to cook another 30 seconds to 1 minute before removing the crepe and placing it on a plate. Continue this process until all of the batter has been used.
Let me know how it works if you try the recipe!!! I would be so happy to see the result! 🤩😘

1187715018,parisbyvegan,B73JjhLJDGU,False,"Avo toast amore! 🥑💚Sooo LET’S TALK ABOUT AVOCADO SUSTAINABILITY, I want to be transparent on this, because it’s a subject that is close to my heart and what I want to share here. 🙂
As you may know, I live partly in Paris, partly to the french country and I started a veggie garden, so hopefully soon I’ll be able to grow and eat most of my veggies and fruit, lucky me!! 🥔🧄🧅🥬🥦🥕🌽🍅🌶🍆🥒
That said there’s always gonna be some “exotic“ goodies that I’ll crave… 🤷‍♀️
Avocado, bananas, chocolate, cashews… are a part of these, maybe you feel the same? 😉
It’s complicated because those, when you live in most European countries are definitely not sustainable and produced without ethical concerns. 💰😷
Now, my approach to this, is trying to source the products and if I sense they’re is the tiniest spot of shady on how it’s produced I WILL SIMPLY NOT BUY THE PRODUCT. 👎🚫❌
But I’ve learned through growing fruits and veggies and #permaculture that avocado can actually grow in France!! Corsica to be precise, as Bananas can be too! My neighbor grows them! 🤟You just have to know the good plant that can adapt on our climate, this one is a Fucca avocado, it’s the season now, organically grown, in a corsica farm. ✨🌱
And yes, it may cost a bit more and I know I’m lucky I can afford that, but I’ll always choose this one, than buying one that comes from unsustainable source.🧐
Your food choices can impact so much dramatically this planet, I urge youth do your research, and consume mindfully.🙏💚
Oh and tip of the day place your avocados with apples so they can ripe more quickly 😀 What about you? How are you dealing with these??? 😘

It may sound like a challenge to be healthy, but i assure you it’s a lot easier than you would have thought. I switched from a vegetarian to a vegan lifestyle about 5 years ago.
✨
Before i found this lifestyle, i used to restrict my calories, and i didn’t know how to eat properly. At first it was a bit hectic, finding the right food for me to eat, I REALLY WISH THE VEGAN BUNDLE EXISTED at this time, surely things would have been a lot easier.🤣
✨
Our goal  with the vegan bundle is to help you transition to a nourishing, healthy and epicurean lifestyle. You’ll find the best knowledge by experts to inspire you, enlighten you and help you to become a happy radiant human! And eat a lot of pizza 🍕😜
