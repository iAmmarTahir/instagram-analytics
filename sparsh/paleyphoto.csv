Mehernosh, a pallbearer - the person in charge of carrying the dead body at a funeral - walks away from one of the two functioning towers of silence in Karachi.
A tower of silence, known as dakhma, is a circular structure built by Zoroastrians for excarnation - that means the exposure of human corpses to the elements for decomposition - in order to avoid contamination of the soil and other natural elements by the decomposing dead bodies. Carrion birds, usually vultures (though no longer in Karachi‚Ä¶) and other scavengers, consume the flesh. Skeletal remains are gathered into a central pit where further weathering and continued breakdown occurs. In this dakhma, reflective mirrors have been fitted inside the tower of silence to increase the heat and help the body decomposing faster.
Karachi, a city of 20 millions, has 800 Zoroastrians known as Parsees, 70% of them are above the age of 70 years old. #zoroastrianism #zoroastrian #towerofsilence #towersofsilence #parsi #parsee",49,2646,1705591681,"{'id': '224526487', 'has_public_page': True, 'name': 'Karachi, Pakistan', 'slug': 'karachi-pakistan'}",https://scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/420176464_18408521320034283_5705493681729208931_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=uhDX7lyQ7m0AX-VXFL0&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD1euXbva3gy_mJa5kW2hR8NncpgFtRvw6WMdiBsW5T_w&oe=65EA5188&_nc_sid=8b3546,False

It was interesting to meander through life between being a photographer, a farmer and be present for the family.
I thought of god a bit, all triggered by a story on Zoroastrianism for National Geographic magazine (coming up). How and why do we often inherit the feeling of being watched by God, god like a massive cctv system‚Ä¶ religion the opium of the people?
Probably god is busy with a lot more than watching you‚Ä¶ Is your god a vengeful one or a god that you will live with and whose law you must respect, like gravity? Lots of fun questions with no real need for answers..
