People often ask what we all can do to lessen our footprints and help species, ecosystems or ethnic minorities in peril. The obvious thing is that we can all make choices, on a daily basis, that can truly make a difference. For example what we eat, what products we buy‚Ä¶if, how, when and what we drive‚Ä¶for whom we vote etc. Low hanging fruits are also to support hard working organizations like @wwfsverige , @tpw_foundation , @synchearth , @janegoodallinst , @mission_blue and @redlist_of_ecosystems to help navigating towards a resilient and healthy future for people and planet! Since I started working full time as a photographer and filmmaker in the mid eighties every day has felt like #worldwildlifeday and for that I am grateful! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
I photographed this leopard in @nyerere_national_park , Selous , Tanzania. The leopard lis one of the world‚Äôs most versatile predators that easily adapts to different environments. It can jump over 6 meters and drag up preys larger than themselves in the trees. The leopard is still hunted predominantly for its beautiful fur.

1552997022,mattiasklumofficial,C3mlPIVtD6I,False,"A hippo in a typical threat display towards a rival in Phinda, South Africa. Hippos are known to be a bit grumpy, but if you read their behavior and play your cards right it always works really well. Hippos move with great ease in water, ‚Äùswimming‚Äù by kicking their hind feet or simply walking on the bottom. They are well-adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, with small ears, eyes and nostrils set at the top of the head. Their senses are super keen even when submerged in water. By closing its ears and nostrils, the adult can stay under water for as long as six minutes. It‚Äôs no secret that hippos love water, which is why the Greeks named them the ‚Äùriver horse.‚Äù Hippos can spend more than 16 hours a day submerged in rivers and lakes to keep their massive bodies cool under the hot African sun. The black market‚Äôs insatiable demand for ivory has turned poachers‚Äô attention away from well-protected elephants to more vulnerable hippos!

Palmoil has been and continues to be a major driver of deforestation of some of the world‚Äôs most biodiverse forests, destroying the habitat of already endangered species like the Orangutan, pygmy elephant, hornbills, king cobras and Sumatran rhino. This forest loss coupled with conversion of carbon rich peat soils are throwing out millions of tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributing to climate change. There also remains some exploitation of workers and child labour. These are serious issues that the whole palm oil sector needs to step up to address because it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

1552997022,mattiasklumofficial,C3Vl-trsvTj,False,"Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day! ‚ù§Ô∏è When resting, lions socialize through a number of behaviours. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are social licking and head rubbing which, for example can be compared with grooming in primates (or human stroking, cuddling, hugging etc). Social licking among lions often occurs in tandem with sometimes drawn out head rubbings. It‚Äôs generally mutual and the recipient clearly express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out of utility, as a lion cannot lick these areas individually. Head rubbing ‚Äì nuzzling one‚Äôs forehead, nose and neck against another lion, is a form of greeting and I often see it after an animal has been apart from the pride, or after a fight or confrontation. In general males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females normally rub females.
