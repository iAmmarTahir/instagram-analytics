‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt look at one of these and not wonder what‚Äôs going on with them,‚Äù said visual ecologist Katie Thomas. (@katiethomaskt)

Dr. Katie went into Sherlock Holmes mode when she first set eyes on this squid!

She binged watched 30 years of underwater videos @mbari_news collected which documented over 150 sightings of this squid & after close inspection, she noticed something really cool

This glittery deep-sea squid floats with its head down & fins up, sporting an enormous yellow eye that faces the water‚Äôs surface & a smaller eye directed toward the sea floor

Here‚Äôs why:

In the deep sea, it‚Äôs dark, almost like permanent nighttime! The big eye helps the squid catch even the tiniest bit of light that filters down from the sun or moon above.

The giant eye is on the hunt for the silhouettes of prey swimming above.

Some animals in the deep sea use a sneaky trick called counter-illumination, where they produce light from their bodies to blend in with the light from above. The squid‚Äôs big eye is adapted to see through this disguise and spot these hidden snacks! ü¶ë

But why is the big eye yellow? Well it turns out yellow filters out certain wavelengths of light, particularly blue light, which is most common in the deep ocean üåä

This filtering can increase contrast & help the squid to better distinguish shapes and movements in the blue-dominated underwater environment.

Fun fact: Athletes wear yellow lenses because they‚Äôve been shown to have a brightening effect in low-light situations due to their ability to reduce light scatter. They also increase the eyes ability to focus clearly üëÅÔ∏è Whelp‚Ä¶GUESS WHAT ATHLETES, Squids already figured this out millions of years ago.

Growing BIG ol‚Äô eyes is a luxury in the squid world, & nature doesn‚Äôt like to waste! So, the strawberry squid is super smart with its eye size‚Äîbig where it helps, small where it can save on the squid-nergy bill! Talk about eye-economical!üòÇ

331002398,ocean,C2NGgXJtmLQ,True,"#DidYouKnow Clownfish are hermaphrodites, meaning they contain both male and female reproductive organs. In fact, when clownfish hatch from their eggs, all of them are born male. Out of the freshly laid group, the largest fish will become the dominant female. The second largest fish will become the dominant male. If the dominant female dies within the school of fish, the dominant male will then switch sexes and become the dominant female!

‚ÄùSome photographs are impossible to explain because the chances of it all coming together are so slim. This is one of those photos for me and probably my favourite image I‚Äôve captured this year.

This photograph beautifully represents the circle of life and showcases the journey that this hatchling is going to go through. There are many barriers facing this hatchling that will prevent it reaching adulthood. Statistically only 1/1000 will reach this status. It will be a journey of growth.

It just so happened that this green turtle was returning back to the ocean after laying her eggs when at the same time a hatchling had hatched and made its way down to the ocean.

It was honestly right place at the right time and I managed to get down so quickly to capture this precise moment before the mother turtle passed the hatchling. A good photographer is always prepared as these moments flash by in a second. Always have your settings ready or custom buttons setup, know your camera inside out and always have it turned on. Expect the unexpected as nature really is unpredictable.‚Äù
