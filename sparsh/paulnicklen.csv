195976455,paulnicklen,C4EQaqapE-i,False,"A group of southern right whales draw closer to a tiny @mitty off the shores of Western Australia. Said to be called right whales for being the “right whale to hunt,” these gentle giants were once heavily targeted by the whaling industry. Their high fat and oil content, coupled with their tendency to stay close to shore, move slowly, and float after being harpooned, tragically made them the ideal victim for whalers. Since the global moratorium on whaling was officially established in the 1980s, their populations have slowly started to recover. As long as we continue to protect key calving and breeding grounds, mothers can raise their newborns in peace. We are very proud and grateful to work with our @sealegacy team to help ensure their future.

195976455,paulnicklen,C3-4033Jrkz,True,"Tucked against the rocky coast, mother southern right whales find solace off of Western Australia. The protected shallows allow them to raise their newborns away from the threat of predators and speeding ships. Many people see the ocean as some muffled and infinite void, unaware that the constant din of boat traffic and mining the sea floor is virtually inescapable to an animal as sensitive as a whale. The more spaces they have to nurture their calves in peace, the more their species can recover.

The fate of her species may seem bleak at times, but I find hope in the growing number of people who care about our planet. If we can learn to lead with the same strength of heart as our fellow wildlife, I believe we have more than a shot at building a better future for all of us. Happy #polarbearday everyone

195976455,paulnicklen,C3vB4hqrnEg,False,"The first few years of a bear cub’s life are filled with uncertainty as they learn to navigate an often unforgiving environment. Winters can be long and brutal, which means they must gorge throughout the warmer months before settling into dens. And while the seasonal salmon runs provide much-needed protein for outlasting the cold, the rivers can quickly become crowded with large males who tend to guard the best fishing spots. However, grizzly cubs have one advantage when it comes to survival; the fierce and unconditional love of their mothers. As long as there is healthy wilderness for bears to roam in peace, siblings like this pair may grow and thrive under mom’s protection.

You squint and scan the vast, sparkling surface waters, lean in, and become captivated by the possibility of witnessing one of our ocean’s great giants. Then, you spot them– another signaling plume followed by the curl of their dorsal ridge, as the magnificent fluke trails behind.

As the whale retreats to its underwater kingdom, you’re left mesmerized, and curious of what lies ahead for them on their journey. Where are they headed? What does their world look like when they slip below the horizon?

On today’s #WorldWhaleDay, we celebrate these astounding creatures and the way they never fail to draw our attention out past the break and down into our ocean’s bustling ecosystems. When we allow the whale to guide our curiosity and accept their invitation to explore what lies beneath the surface, we’re welcomed by the knowledge of their compounding impact, and find our gratefulness for their presence only grows.

Just off the shores of The Bahamas, our team came across this bottlenose dolphin crater feeding, a hunting strategy named for the cavities left scattered across the ocean floor. After using echolocation to spot fish hiding deep in the soft sand, the dolphins dive in with their snouts, sometimes down to their pectoral fins, before wriggling back out moments later with their catch. Currently @Mitty and I are preparing to return to life aboard the SeaLegacy 1 and get back to working directly on the conservation front lines — starting in New Zealand. Follow along as we join our crew and find out where @SeaLegacy is headed next.
