When the Tidy Style team arrived they made me feel at ease from the moment they walked in the door.  Their smiles can really light up the room and their skills change the vibe of the room. 

They really know how to maximize space.  The space was not functional and I was back and forth getting dressed between my dresser in the bedroom and the closet.  The changes they made makes so much more sense and feels more intentional! 

Just a few ways this organization has already impacted me‚Ä¶
üíô Streamlined my mornings so getting ready is a breeze! 
üíô Calmed my spirit with a tidy space. 
üíôMade this mama thankful for the small things, like getting organized.

1241553,maraferreira,Cwu3Pl6O5nl,False,"Rainy mornings call for some baking! üåßÔ∏è This method of making banana bread in an 8x8 might be the best idea yet. It cooks so perfectly and there‚Äôs more of that perfectly crunchy sweet top! 

After-School Banana Bread üçåüçû

Ingredients
 * Nonstick baking spray, for the pan
 * 8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, melted and cooled, plus softened butter for serving
 * 1 cup packed light brown sugar
 * 2 large eggs, beaten
 * 1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
 * 4 to 5 very ripe bananas, mashed (I like to leave them a little chunky)
 * 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
 * 1 teaspoon baking soda
 * 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
 * 1/2 cup chopped pecans 
 * 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar as needed

Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Spray an 8 x 8-inch pan with nonstick baking spray or line it with parchment paper.
2. In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl with a handheld electric mixer), beat together the butter, brown sugar, eggs, and vanilla until well blended. Add the bananas and mix until combined.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat just until combined. Add the pecans (if using) and mix until combined.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the granulated sugar over the top. I like to cover the whole surface completely with sugar; use as much as you‚Äôd like.
5. Bake until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let the bread cool slightly in the pan on a rack. Slice and serve warm with butter.
6. When completely cooled, cover the pan with foil and store at room temperature for up to 2 days.
