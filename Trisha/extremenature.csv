Some of the coral reefs offshore of #KeyLargo haven‚Äôt experienced boat traffic nor human visitors for many weeks. Will this help our chances of documenting the elusive spotted eagle ray ? We used drones to monitor the area and within minutes discovered a large group of several dozen spotted eagle rays, also known as a ‚Äúfever‚Äù. We were able to track the eagle rays with drones and quickly deployed into the water and snorkeled right up next to the them. They were beautiful and looked like birds flying under the water. Mission accomplished!
