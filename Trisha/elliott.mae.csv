üî∫IMPORTANT: you MUST receive clearance from your doctor and if possible a women‚Äôs health physiotherapist, after 6 weeks postpartum before attempting this workout. Once you have that clearance, this can be your potential starting point. Begin basic, slow and easy. Reduce reps and sets as necessary and adjust to your individual level.
üëâ Repeat 2-3 times a week for 2-3 weeks or until level two feels suitable. 

Ensure you can engage and control your core / pelvic floor with all movements. If you‚Äôre struggling with this, try to see a women‚Äôs health physio in person to help you with that proper connection. 

Remember, there‚Äôs no race or competition. Be kind to yourself and don‚Äôt rush yourself or push your body before it‚Äôs ready. üíõ
