Not only are they pack hunters, but they don't seem to take crap from anyone, including Jaguars. Sometime soon I will share a video of a Jaguar hiding in a tree to get away from 6 Giant River Otters hassling it from the water below. What a sight!

30591774,colbybrownphotography,C3ArjI5uh-o,False,"One of the most exciting shoots I did last year was working with the @eastafricanreptiles & Taylor Ashe Antivenom center in Watamu, Kenya to photograph spitting cobras. This particular snake is a Red Spitting Cobra (Naja pallida). Photographing these snakes is a challenge because they are not only highly venomous but they can be very aggressive/defensive as well. I had to wear a full face shield, which allowed me to avoid getting any of the venom they spit in my eyes, nose or ears.

Snakes are sadly often misunderstood and killed on sight no matter the circumstance, which is horrible because they are such a vital part of the eco systems we all live in. Organizations like East Africa Reptile's focus much of their attention not only on education and safety,  but in helping to safely remove snakes from people's homes and properties around Kenya, further increasing their chances of survival.

Unfortunately for me, it was the wrong time of year as they tend to love the hot desert nights. We did however find a number of these Saw Scaled Vipers (Echis Carinatus). These beautiful snakes are easily the most deadly snake in the UAE, accounting for more snake bites per year than all other snakes combined. They can be aggressive, have a quick strike and a very powerful venom.
