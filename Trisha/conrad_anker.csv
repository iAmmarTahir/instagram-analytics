12243093,conrad_anker,C4ACQ3roO5j,False,"Climbing brings us together.  Once you challenge yourself with gravity and share this experience with your friends something changes. It's the international language of belaying and spotting. It's the same everywhere. You have to trust someone to achieve your goals. 

@memphisroxclimbing has been a flywheel for the good that climbing brings. Built in the shell of a supermarket with a state of the facility, Rox is bringing gym climbing and outdoor experiences to South Memphis.

With a pay as one can model, the gym is open to everyone. Climbing as I was introduced to it was free. The cliffs were at  end of the road and my dad and his buddies had the gear and knowledge. I still recall the moment when climbing and being outdoors latched on. It's that same emotion that we see with the people we welcome to the crag, mountain and gym. Let's keep that going! 

The freedom that climbing brings comes at a cost. The facility and staff are monthly obligations. In business, as in climbing, the unexpected happens. In this case a burst water pipe needs immediate attention. To keep Rox a safe place (it's a polling station, health care facility and restaurant) the security team needs immediate funding. Going without costs the program more. 

Rox has been a part of my life for the past six years. I've made new friends, shared backcountry experience & knowledge while climbing outdoors and learned from each other on how to address the challenges of race in the United States. 

If you believe in the mission of @memphisroxclimbing please consider a donation. It will be put to good use. If you have the chance to visit Memphis, stop by the gym. You'll find family by the time you have warmed up.

12243093,conrad_anker,C1i8a8iMt5O,False,"30 years ago today,  the last day of the year,  @johnmiddendorf4 and I climbed Cerro Torre, Patagonia via the Compressor Route. (South East Ridge) Established in 1970 by Cesare Maestri with a gasoline powered drill, the controversial route sported a stack of bolts and was the quick way to the top. 

John and I enjoyed the climb,  yet these was something amiss. The wildness of this peak was sacrificed for human ego. Maestri, making up for his fanciful ascent of 1959, bolted the peak into submission. 
 
In 2012 the late Hayden Kennedy and 
@jason_kruk removed the bolts, giving the mountain its power back and creating controversy.

If Cerro Torre is a peak that you are interested in please listen to @climbinggold. The recent season includes the Maestri Mystery with insight from @kellycordes, author of ""The Tower"", the definitive book on this subject.

In reviewing my journal from 30 years ago I reflect on how climbing has changed. Even if we have better weather  forecasts and lighter & stronger gear, the sense of self discovery one gets from a proper Patagonian beat down still remains. This primal connection to living is as real as it gets.

12243093,conrad_anker,C1fF_-rpzx6,False,"Kyle Allen Rott 1987 - 2023 
On  November  25th we lost Kyle in a fall in Hyalite Canyon, Montana. My heart goes out to his mother and sister and the South Dakota family of this fine man.  For his friends the loss is immediate. The years of being together,  weaving the fabric of friendship through shared experiences are gone.

Kyle was a climber. Once he realized that the pursuit of gravity was his life's calling,  he lived with a singular purpose. ""Let's go climb.""

As someone close to Kyle, his ""uncle"" by age and knowing him with our family, his loss is another weight on the scale of ""is it worth it"".

Many of my close friends are introverts. In school we found each other and climbing self selected us. Kyle and I climbed together for 15 years - most of the time hiking the folds of Southwest Montana looking for the cliffs and drips that sustain us. In between climbs he helped out by housesitting for the climbing community. For those of that trusted Kyle without houses and animals - you know how conscientious he was.  Kyle's humble approach to life - not entertaining anything superfluous - was reflected by living in his truck.  Which made housesitting a good balance. 

While Kyle was quiet and shy in a room of his peers, there was this friendly side that Kyle shared with people in life. More than once he would carefully explain the gadgets needed to climb to curious people on the trail. This translated well to the guiding he did with Montana Alpine Guides and the Mountain School in Yosemite. 

At our service for Kyle we wrote in a small book for his mother and family. His worldly possessions, kept tidy in a Livingston storage locker, spread out over a picnic table, passed to his friends. They will cherish his memory and then ply the seas of gravity, risking it all for the moment. For his age peers, dealing with non sequential death, many for the first time, left adrift questioning and bonding closer with those that stand. I was there. And now 30 years later as an elder, with culpability and responsibility.

We love you Kyle for energy you brought to our climbing adventures. 

We love you for the reminder to live calm.
