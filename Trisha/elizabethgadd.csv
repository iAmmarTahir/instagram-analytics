A self portrait series from just a few weeks ago in Deadvlei, Namibia.  A place I’ve dreamed of visiting for a decade… and yet being there in person, walking barefoot across the dead marsh under these 600-900 year old skeleton trees, was such a surreal experience unlike what I imagined it would be.  It’s strange to walk through a place that feels so long dead and forgotten - yet still full of life and wonder.

I originally had an entirely different series of images in my mind for here, involving a couple of different colourful dresses (red and gold) and dance poses mimicking and flowing with these trees… but when I arrived here, just as the sun rose and lit up my surroundings and as I walked over the last sand dune to see the dead pan valley floor below, all those earlier visions I had simply vanished. Thankfully, tucked away in the bottom of my backpack under my camera gear and red/gold dresses (anyone else cram dresses and chocolate into their backpack as a general hiking norm?), I had also this white dress as a back-up… and I was so glad I brought it, because all I could actually envision in person here was a balance of death and life, light and dark, a dream walking through decay. 

And so that’s how I spent the next 3 hours - walking and running around barefoot, feeling connection, contrast and awe, and creating this new series as it came to me. 🤍 What a surreal place.

This was taken at 2am in Iceland - the only time I’ve ever seen this location, Reynisfjara beach, completely empty of visitors.  The basalt columns eerily rose out of the midsummer night fog, and everything was still and silent, even the waves in the ocean right next to these columns - a calm rarity I’ve never seen here before. 

This was my first night ever being high enough in the north to experience no complete darkness, even at 2am.  The light was soft and blue, and the settings and emotions felt in this place all came together to inspire this self portrait… a moment of connection with the ancient earth. 💙",92,5409,1689522357,,https://instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/361331718_997731671265882_2955120389390637231_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_ohc=hEjxjpdRcO4AX8WcERG&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDsSCZRNQr6OiNjxnZnMMkxMIESE0zlzyA21nFqV6kzMg&oe=65E7AA2E&_nc_sid=8b3546,True

I came across this moss-covered boulder in the woods a couple of weeks ago during one of the Rockies super warm Chinooks winds, which melted all the winter snow for a few days. It felt so surreal to wander around the forest and mountains of Banff National Park in what felt like early summer weather!  I haven’t taken a self portrait in the last several weeks just because it’s been sooooo freezing cold, so I took advantage of this extra warm day to forest bathe, listen to the birds, rest, soak in my surroundings and to create a new image to remember this feeling of February restfulness this year.

Here’s a new(ish) image from the end of November, which I finally took the time to edit this week. 🤓 The very last of the autumnal colours tend to hang on for a while in these rain-forests of BC. 

On this damp and foggy day of forest wandering, I was drawn to the colourful ferns and the last clinging maple leaves that gave a burst of colour, contrasting brightly against the fluorescent mossy greens of the forest.  The surreal blue fog just tied everything together for this magical scene. 🥰

A self portrait taken at midnight in Iceland last summer (the time of endless light!). 💙

So far every morning this year I’ve been deep diving into my journal, writing out and contemplating what it would be like to live lighter.  To cultivate an ease and lightness in my mind, to be less busy, to be more trusting in the unknown future.  To play more, and let my inner child lead me romping through the woodlands and meadows, inspired by my imagination. 

I thought I’d share this lil blurb I brain-barfed out onto the pages this morning. 🤓⬇️

“This year I want to let go of pressure.  Both the pressure I put on myself, and the pressure the societal world puts on us all. 

I let go of the pressure to be perfect. The pressure to look a certain way. The pressure to post every day. I let go of the pressure I put on myself to create better and better images, videos and paintings.

This year I embrace lightness. I celebrate imperfection, because when I allow myself and my creations to be made imperfectly with my mind open, it creates space for a world of new ideas, opportunities and surprise happenings I never would have dreamed up myself in my “perfect world”.

This year I let my true essence take the seat of my mind and being. I take time to intentionally practice dwelling in my truest state - the state of complete trust, leading to peace and joyful lightness, where I feel the most myself. 

This year I allow myself to live. Not by someone else’s standards, and not by the standards I once thought I should hold over myself. 

I live by listening. I listen intently to what brings me a sense of joy, rightness and lightness. I listen to what I can give - what I can naturally offer and help bring out in others.

I live by being kind. I live in gratitude for the freedom I’m so, so, so incredibly fortunate to have access to.

I allow this freedom to be protected, nurtured and loved, to not let this gift be taken for granted or hijacked by the endless hustling pressures of the world.

This year I embrace lightness. I put my heart first, and I let love, trust and wonder lead the way down this path of life. This one chance we have to truly live.” 🤍",32,2074,1704489913,,https://instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/416443839_237135589330213_4566011392255558780_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=r3-WBn6AGnsAX9nygig&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCIlEJVqbxJtGtDQwVqQ2Y2uHfCEhRpJhdWhPhGyOiq1A&oe=65E975C0&_nc_sid=8b3546,False

There’s so many thoughts I could share from the past year, the ups and downs, the incredible things I’ve seen and done, the hard struggles, overwhelm and work that came with it, the hopes and dreams for the future, the ongoing quest for a calmer mind, and many precious moments I wish could last forever. 

…but I’m going to simply end the year by sharing 10 slides that mean something to me in this moment. 🥰

1. “Ever Enduring” - a self portrait taken during a 400km hike across the mountains of Scotland in April.  One of the hardest and most beautiful experiences I’ve had, and that I’m most proud of completing this year.

2. Backpacking in the Tombstone Mountains of the Yukon (still with the sword prop for photos, hehe). It felt so special to do a lot of hiking and camping with Pepper this year - he’ll be 13 years old soon, so I’ve been feeling extra aware/grateful for every adventure we have together. 🥹❤️

3.  @kristopherandres and I have spent more than half the year on the road, the trails or overseas this year. I can’t believe I get to share my dream nomadic life with this human. 🥰

4.  A masterpiece by @stasia.schmidt portraying Kris, Pepper and myself.

5.  Kris trying to shake off a backwards waterfall.

6. I ate a lot of vegan lemon cake this year while sitting outside in the sun, and it was grand. I also never cared for lemon cake before this year, but I guess my tastebuds changed because now I can’t stop craving it. 😂

7.  My favourite novel I read this year.  I’ve never empathized with the personality of a main character more - socially awkward but incredibly brave, her strength being kindness. 

8. Meeting @melissa_schaefer (creator of @magazine.mother ) in Copenhagen and seeing the magazine for my first time - with my photo on the cover! 🥰

9. More precious moments with Pepper. A reminder to stay present.

10. Reflections from @chelseakauai ‘s latest post - thoughts I’ve been heavily deep diving into this past month, and am using to guide my priorities in 2024.  Perhaps these reflection prompts can help you, too. ❤️🥰

Wishing you all a beautiful winter solstice today (at least, winter to everyone up here in the northern hemisphere!)

I have to admit that I absolutely, undoubtedly LOVE these long, dark and moody days (sorry to all my summer lovers out there!)… and I sorta secretly long for winter solstice all year. 😅 

It’s a time where I somehow feel far less guilty about letting my mind and life slow down, where I can become like the trees and the bears in winter, resting quietly and hibernating from the world in my own little introverted cocoon.  It’s in the soft, quiet, candle-lit hours that I feel the most rested and at peace, and therefore more renewed and rekindled with creativity and short bursts of adventurous energy during the day - when these short hours of daylight are a gift, appreciated even more in the winter. 🥰
