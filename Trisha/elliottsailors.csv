This morning I learned 
the English word gauze 
(finely woven medical cloth) 
comes from the Arabic word Ghazza 
because Gazans have been skilled weavers for centuries 

I wondered then 

how many of our wounds
have been dressed
because of them 

and how many of theirs
have been left open

Episode 07 with @elliottsailors 
Diving into the topic of Authenticity. 

I loved how Elliott describes their coaching process, of encouraging clients to examine their own limiting beliefs. How might you be compartmentalizing yourself? How are you different in the company of different people? By examining our own limiting beliefs and deconstructing the various aspects of our being, we can then bring it back together into a unified and more authentic whole. ‚ú®

Same with the Jewellery I design. It is intended to encouraging the wearer to embrace all sides of themselves; the strong, the gentle, the powerful and the beautiful. It‚Äôs all within you.üñ§ü§ç

During this episode I spoke with activist, model and Holistic Life Coach, Elliott Sailors. 
We discussed the theme of Authenticity, and how it‚Äôs the key to a finding satisfaction in life. 

We all have such a unique life journey. Everyone‚Äôs purpose and truth is theirs alone to discover. The important thing is learning to tune in to that inner knowing, and accepting ourselves in entirety. When we show up authentically, we inspire other to do the same, and are able to make deeper, and more meaningful connections. 
Our conversation was a lot of fun - it was open, fluid and very inspiring.
We hope you enjoy it as much as we did!
