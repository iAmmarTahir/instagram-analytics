Drawing from his extensive repertoire, Ed showcases his varied personal projects, collaborations with NGOs and Foundations, and editorial contributions to acclaimed publications such as National Geographic, Time, and The New Yorker. 

Together, we examine diverse visual formats like photographs, multimedia, and short films, exploring the vibrant array of creative possibilities. Engage in an intimate and safe environment to present your work, exploring innovative methods of visual storytelling using available mediums like photography, text, and motion. Conceptual approaches are welcomed. Receive both individual and group critiques on your workshop creations, while also having the chance to seek feedback on other ongoing projects.

In contrast to the documentary and journalistic approaches that characterize most of my photography, my “abandoned moments” work instead relies on intuition and my gut in order to capture images without looking through the viewfinder. It’s a way of making images that I discovered very early in my journey that has continued to be an essential part of my visual style.⁣

⁣
In photography, mirrors play an important role, serving as a compositional device, and as an element that makes the image more magical, dramatic, mysterious or just visually engaging. The creative use of mirrors in photography gives a poetic license to create imagery that is less obvious or straightforward, but allows for alternative ways of capturing a moment, a character and a scene. It can also be an effective way of avoiding direct contact with a subject or to render a sensitive or difficult situation without direct confrontation.⁣

These images from my archive reflect the multitude of ways mirrors serve as visual devices in photography.⁣

‎  مدينة الموتى : ما قبل ٣٠ عام | معرض تصوير فوتوغرافي للمصور ايد كاشي

After the loss of some of our heritage buildings due to the latest city of the dead demolitions, this exhibition depicts the timeless historic area as photographed in 1993 by celebrated photographer Ed Kashi.  You are invited to one of the oldest cemeteries in the world, as curated by Photopia as an immersive experience for the viewers to contemplate and enjoy.

Opening night: 23 February, 2024 &  lasts till 2 March , 2024 
Working hours: 12 pm- 9 pm 
Location: Citadel Cairo 

The oldest continuously used Muslim Cemetery in the world, the City of the Dead, with history tracing back to the seventh century. Cairo’s vast 13th century cemetery, the only living occupants, were caretakers paid by families to maintain their ancestral mausoleums.
In 1993, over one hundred and twenty thousand people lived, worked, shopped, and went to school in and among the mausoleums. Today, that number is much higher, huts are built around tombstones, between which laundry is hung to dry, and masses of people live and work in dwellings built amongst the grand burial sites of famous religious and political figures of Egypt’s rich history. This exhibition pays tribute to the historic area, its people & their stories.
This exhibition is sponsored by the US embassy in Cairo.

4681303,edkashi,C3DwmcMPmIK,False,"A recent article in The Economist reported on the issue of stray cows in India and how the right’s pro-cow policies are doing little to protect the sacred animals. I’ve traveled to India over 10 times on assignment and have seen with my own eyes the way cows are a part of daily life. I’ve always been fascinated by the special position cows have in Hindu society. At first I thought it was unusual, but over the years and many visits I’ve come to not only appreciate the beliefs around a cow’s sacredness, but also understand that virtually every part of a cow, from their feces, meat, bones, skin, urine, etc, has a value. Whether it’s using their feces for fuel or building your home, to their skin for clothing and protection, it’s incredible what overall value, at least from a human’s perspective of dominion over the natural world, represents. No wonder cows are considered sacred. ⁣
⁣
But I’ve also seen the downside of this reverence, where cows are left to wander and get sick and literally die on the streets. The ruling conservative party, BJP, has passed several “pro-cow” policies like a ban on cow slaughter, but that has only led to the proliferation of stray cows, now numbering over 5 million. 

Abandoned, they often feed on plastic bags and other garbage, and can cause car crashes and destroy crops. One thing is certain – the current situation is untenable and more must be done to protect India’s stray cows.⁣

There have been couples I’ve met in my lifetime, and I imagine anyone reading this has experienced the same thing, who are so perfectly matched, that if they were to ever break up you’d think the world was coming to an end. The qualities that I see exemplifying coupling are trust, care, being able to listen and make space for a mate’s feelings and thoughts, and of course being able to laugh with each other. Yet, some people couple out of desperation, need, economics, lust and social pressures.⁣
