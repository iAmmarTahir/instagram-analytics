In this frame Marine scientist @neshaichida gently swims a juvenile zebra shark through its nursery sea pen habitat  at  @rarcc (Raja Ampat Research Conservation Center) located at @papuadivingresorts on Kri island in Indonesia. A team of biologists affectionately known as shark Nannie’s will conduct a final health assessment before the shark is transported for release into Wayag Islands a patrolled Marine Protected Area where historic populations of zebra sharks were fished out. This global collaboration of  70+ stakeholders from 15 countries (and growing)  is the first of kind to Rewild sharks from 44 participating aquariums.
