344130218,christianziegler,CxXinsRMJYL,False,"Bonobo Matriarchy: Family Grooming

In the world of bonobos, females hold the power. They form high-ranking groups, supported by their sons, and maintain a unique social structure. Grooming rituals, like this gathering on a fallen tree, are vital for strengthening these bonds.

Photographing wild bonobos is a rare opportunity. They exclusively inhabit the lush tropical forests on the southern side of the Congo River in Central Africa in DRC. Lui Kotale Bonobo Project is one of the few places where we have the priviledge to witness bonobos in the wild.

For nearly three decades, German researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute for Animal Behavior, Barbara Fruth and her husband Gottfried Hohmann, have delved into the lives of these incredible creatures, with 18 of those years at Lui Kotale.

Female bonobos exhibit profound maternal instincts, nurturing their young for several years, often nursing them until they reach the age of five or six. In this serene moment, a mother finds solace on the forest floor while her baby drinks.

Capturing these intimate scenes is a rare privilege, as wild bonobos, our closest living relatives, inhabit only the dense tropical forests south of the Congo River in Central Africa.

For nearly three decades, dedicated German researchers from the Max-Planck-Institute for Animal Behavior, Barbara Fruth and her husband Gottfried Hohmann, have devoted themselves to the study of wild bonobos. Their extensive commitment spans nearly 30 years, with 18 years spent at Lui Kotale, next to Salonga N.P in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Join us on this journey of understanding and preservation as we share the remarkable story of these extraordinary primates in their natural habitat.

Few places on Earth offer the chance to photograph wild bonobos, our closest living relatives. These incredible creatures exclusively inhabit the dense tropical forests of Central Africa, both to the north and south of the Congo River.

For nearly three decades, German researchers Barbara Fruth and Gottfried Hohmann, affiliated with the Max-Planck-Institute for Animal Behavior, have dedicated themselves to the study of wild bonobos. A significant portion of this research has taken place over 18 years at Lui Kotale.

This aerial view captures the vast, unspoiled primary forest surrounding the Lui Kotale research camp, nestled on the fringes of Salonga National Park in the DRC.

I am honored to have won the portrait category in 'Nature in focus' with this image ‚Äì thank you all for your support, especially the jury !

During my adventures near LuiKotale field station in the Democratic Republic of Congo I had a remarkable encounter. I witnessed a young male Bonobo tenderly petting a small mongoose.

This fascinating moment continued as he carefully held the mongoose while enjoying fruit in a nearby tree with the rest of his group.

However, this bond may not be as innocent as it seems. Bonobos occasionally include meat in their diet, and it's likely this young mongoose was caught when its mother was hunted by the group.
