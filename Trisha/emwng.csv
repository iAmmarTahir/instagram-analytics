Just about a year ago, I happened to watch some new people train their dogs. I remember I was so impressed. Their sessions started with intention - there was a warm up routine (something completely foreign to me at that point). Then the entire session just flowed effortlessly between obedience and play. There was no awkward down time or disengagement between the handler and the dog. The dogs looked so happy to be working and the handlers were clear and focused in their communication. I remember thinking, wow, how do we get on that level ü§©

Fast forward to 2024 and it feels like we are finally making some moves! There‚Äôs still a ton of work to do, but I‚Äôve been so grateful to learn from some super talented teams these past few months.
