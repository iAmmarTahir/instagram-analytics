Despite managing our future liviloods, 85% of these giants have been marked as failing in critical areas like fossil fuels, and deforestation and land-use. It’s clear: our money isn’t aligning with our values for a sustainable planet.

But here’s the twist - you have the power to shift the narrative. 🌱✊ By visiting the link in our bio’s, you can demand better from your pension provider with just a click.

Many of you may know I’ve worked in insurance for over 15 years… well, insurance isn’t just an incredibly thrilling & sexy industry to work in (😈😉) - it’s also a hugely powerful tool for supercharging our world towards safe, clean energy. 

🫡 I’m proud to join @insure.our.future’s global week of action & I invite you all to join me - starting TOMORROW!

📆 Monday Feb 26th to Mar 3rd 2024

🔗 TO GET INVOLVED SIGN UP AT LINK IN BIO
bit.ly/globalweekofaction2024

🌍 For the first time people across the roles are joining together to demand that insurance companies like  @aiginsurance @zurichinsurance and @tokiomarine stop enabling polluters and #InsureOurFutureNOW for a livable planet.

🛢️ Insurance is the Achilles heel of the fossil fuel industry - without insurance, new oil, gas or coal cannot go ahead.

⏳ Campaigning has already made new coal plants almost uninsurable. Now let’s do the same for oil and gas.

🌞 Insurers have huge power. At the moment, they’re enabling dirty projects like Arctic drilling & North Sea oil. But they can instead help build the safe, clean energy projects we need.

✊ Let’s convince them to be climate leaders - choosing a safe, healthy world for our children & loved ones over short-term profits.

📌 Over 60 events across 27 countries - including Uganda, Czech Republic, the Arctic, USA, Brazil, Japan, Korea...!

Last year I travelled to #OulankaNationalPark to experience the trip curated by @exodustravels that combined the best of winter activities with a real tangible purpose. Whilst exploring we were sampling the rivers for eDNA, which is a relatively new technology to monitor and record local biodiversity.

For me, having had the privilege of travelling the world, the purpose of this trip really sets it a cut above a regular holiday.
