Waiting for Serhiy

His attempts to escape the Russian siege had failed. He and his fellow Ukrainian Marines were surrounded, dozens of miles from friendly lines. They were nearly out of food and ammunition. Some panicked, others quietly resigned themselves to what would come next.
Then, a few days later, senior sailor Sergey Hrebinyk and his comrades emerged from the sprawling Ilyich Iron and Steel works in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. He quickly messaged his older sister: ‚ÄúHi Anna. Our brigade surrenders. In captivity today. I also don‚Äôt know what will happen next. I love you.‚Äù
It was April 12, 2022.

Nearly two years later, on the second anniversary of the start of Russia‚Äôs full scale invasion, Serhiy Hrebinyk, 24, remains in captivity as a prisoner of war, held somewhere in Russia. His family sits in purgatory, trapped between that day in April and the present.

The initial panicked flurry of calls to the Red Cross, the Ukrainian military and local officials subsided as official proof of life took months to come. The war dragged on, and now, like thousands of other Ukrainian families with relatives in captivity, the Hrebinyks wait.

‚ÄúLife, of course, has changed. Almost every day is filled with tears,‚Äù said Svitlana Hrebinyk, Serhiy‚Äôs mother.

Emerging from an underground bunker in a tree line, Ukrainian soldiers fired their 50+ year old Soviet-era artillery at Russian frontline infantry near Bakhmut. 

The town cleared another acre of ground and began digging fresh graves to make room for many of the 52 killed in one vicious Russian missile strike on mourners who‚Äôd gathered for a wake in the village of Hroza. 

A steady flow of injured soldiers, cared for by combat medics in this hidden Donetsk region outpost. 

Boots and bloody clothing, cut away from injured Ukrainian soldiers before evacuation from the front, were heaped in the hallway and yard at one combat medic outpost in the Kupiansk direction.
