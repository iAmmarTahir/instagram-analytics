7453912,emily_katz,C2_EagUvLdz,True,"The last five days have been a whirlwind. I had my last day at Circle Round and left a little bit unceremoniously since we had to fly to Arizona the next morning very early. Adam‚Äòs mom had a stroke and he flew here a few days before. My mom and stepdad were in Arizona already for the gem show, and so we got to spend one glorious afternoon and evening with them before they flew back to Connecticut. 
This trip has been quite a bit different than many in the past. We‚Äôve spent a lot of time going to visit Adam‚Äòs mom in the hospital and a lot of time at home cooking and running around after Palomino. There‚Äôs a level of breathtaking that I am finding myself becoming more aware of. 
My personal breath. I realize how much I hold without breathing. And then when I finally sit down, my nervous system feels so frazzled. Adam is doing so amazing, holding space supporting his dad being so calm and loving and kind. It‚Äôs his nature. But it still fills me with gratitude to experience the calmness of his loving heart.  How he shows up in crisis and in calm. 
We have a few more days down here and then we fly home to start the next adventure which includes taking a well deserved break, pivoting @modernmacrame /closing down, dreaming up the next direction of focus for my creative entrepreneurial spirit, and BEING. Being for myself. For Pal. For Adam. For my family. For my community.
I will share more about my departure from Circle Round soon, but for now I‚Äôm focusing on being present, playing with Pal, we took our first bike ride together today!
It‚Äôs a mix of grief and gratitude.
Sending love and peace to all.

I awoke in the multiple times filled with worry for him, and for all the people without power or shelter. A fear gripping my heart for him and them.

7453912,emily_katz,C0hgb6qvKtH,False,"A theme lately has been
Rupture & Repair.
I'm learning about this with
my therapist as we heal
some of my childhood
traumas.
How can our nervous
systems know that it's safe
to trust someone if any
time there is a rupture,
there is no repair? That
conflict can be an
opportunity for discussion,
for showing love instead of
fear and hate?

Everyone is dealing with
their feelings about this
war/genocide in different
ways. Like @aleladiane
mentioned in her post I shared. Some mourn
privately, some post and call
to action. Some do those
things without sharing
publicly.
Some people are privately
experiencing depression, or
crisis, or myriad things.
So please show up to love
our sisters here. It's hard
enough being human, but
without compassion, how
can we learn?

And if my actions or perceived lack of
actions have hurt you in
some way,
I'm deeply sorry.
Its overwhelming to be the
owner of two businesses
(one which is closing)
Taking care of a toddler,
Being extremely under
financially resourced,
Experiencing the darkest &
scariest postpartum
depression I imagined, all
the while the world around
us in climate crisis, people
are experiencing
unbelievable suffering.
It's too much.

I've been going non stop.
Now, I'm actually sick in
bed with COVID, and have
a moment to catch my
breath. (Though I have
shortness of breath)
Thank you to everyone who
is out there being the voice
of resistance.
I'm doing my best. And if
you don't think that's
enough, then I'm sorry.
But if you have a problem,
please, how do we heal
without connection?
There is no healing through
violence.
There is no healing through
giving someone the cold
shoulder.
There is no healing through
avoidance.
We heal through our
suffering being welcomed
in, shared, and not by being
pushed out.

Sending love to all

All who are suffering 
All who experience pain in their own ways. 

And to 
All who are celebrating 
(Because we need to also hold dear the beauty right in front of us) our health, the faces of those we love, our friends and community, our children.",47,619,1701891380,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/407751837_18401932879029913_2313739974840645472_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=lm2UuJe7J3cAX-c-D8N&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCoKZ5StGUl92Ec5KbAmPPiLURRbKaa6ZuBnmkf7aLs5g&oe=65E83C5F&_nc_sid=8b3546,False

From @biddytarot :
The king of wands

The King of Wands represents pure fire energy in its masculine form. Unlike the other Wands court cards, the King is not so interested in creation and creativity, or in dreaming up ideas and implementing them himself. Instead, he is more inclined to take an idea and then enlist others to help him actualise it. Thus, when the King of Wands appears in a Tarot reading, it is a sign you are stepping into the role of a visionary leader, ready to direct your people towards a common goal. You have a clear vision of where you want to go, and now you are manifesting that vision with the support of those around you. Others naturally gravitate towards you because you are charismatic, focused, and determined, and they believe in you and your vision. They want to be a part of what you are manifesting and are here to support you one hundred percent of the way. You are also masterful at getting other people to do your work for you while keeping them on-side throughout the process.
The King of Wands reminds you to lead your life with intent, vision and a long-term view. You have a grand idea of what is truly possible, and you will stop at nothing to see it through. You achieve a lot because you are clear about your future direction and how you will get there ‚Äì and do not waste your time on activities or relationships you believe will lead nowhere. You never just go with the flow; instead, you prefer to embark on a direct and robust course of action. And you are inspired by long-term, sustainable success, wanting to have a lasting impact. You are here to leave a legacy.
The appearance of the King of Wands also suggests that an opportunity is presenting itself to you, and you now have the power to take on the challenge. You are the determining factor in this situation. If you want it to be successful, it will. And equally, if you do not fully commit to it, this seed will struggle to blossom and grow. You can create any outcome you wish, so be mindful about your intentions and vision. You hold the power.",12,250,1701631660,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/407905039_18401380780029913_1488982850668195158_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=Tu85-o98uAMAX86YZs1&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfD9CNnEi7T448DvN5U99Q_nbeXZs4CiuLtrTODiVONoEA&oe=65E8F7AD&_nc_sid=8b3546,False

There are 100‚Äôs of photos and videos of Donut Underfoot PorterKatz from the past 10 years, it‚Äôs impossible to pick 10. There will be more to share for sure.

The story of Donut:
After about a year of living together one day Adam said what do you think about getting a dog. I thought hey how about we foster one instead. We have such busy lifestyles and maybe we should see if bringing a dog into our lives will be a good fit. That was on a Friday. On Monday this little scruffy sickly fearful creature showed up to our house,  he had eaten an entire plastic bowl and wouldn‚Äôt eat in front of us for months. After just a few days we decided there was no way we could give him back and we just we named him Donut after the tiny donut shaped ball he curled up into. Circa 2013?

Donut was our eternal adventure buddy. He came everywhere with us. He came to work every single day to the Macram√© studio and Adam‚Äôs screen printing space. He climbed ladders. He rode in backpacks. He hiked mountains. He‚Äôs snuggled under blankets and sleeping bags in tents and in the back of our Ford truck. He was a protector. All that he wanted was love. And we gave him as much as we could.
