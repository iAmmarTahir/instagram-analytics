12488328,garancedore,C328nZyN5kc,False,"Recently I stayed at a hotel in London designed by Kit Kemp and I found myself loving the feeling of it without liking all of the elements of the decor, and I liked that I didn't like it all because it challenged my sense of taste.

It was an interesting experience about something that's been ringing a bell inside of me for a while-the fact that I could easily settle into a comfortable ""pleasing"" sense of taste, specifically for interiors. 

I think it's the Pinterest effect, probably a lack of confidence but also the fact that everywhere, homes feel less and less personal and more and more like they're coming out of a catalog and a specific ""vibe,"" such as the ""neutral countryside style"" or the ""LA mid century"" or the more recent round shapes and soft colors. 

So now I am trying to build my confidence, because without confidence all we can do is... Sort of become generic. 

I also try to push myself to make ""mistakes"" and just go with my gut, which is really hard as I HATE being caught in a moment of bad taste üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Anyway here are a few images of what challenges me, and that I therefore should explore...

1/ the mix of prints. I actually love bold prints on sofas but I've always been too scared of regretting them to go ahead.

2/ photos and paintings in the kitchen. I'd love to see that more often!

3/ absolute mix of everything. So personal I love it. The computer shows it's an old image. I think homes in the 90s where quite good at capturing this sense of freedom...

4/ super bold and awesome matchy-matchy moment.

5/ joyfully not aligned plates on the wall.

6/ layering rugs (that I've always loved doing)

7/ loving the very bold wallpaper!

I don't have credits for these photos so let me know if you do!

There really a bit of magic in these untouched English landscapes, and true joy in finding oneself in these uncomplicated interiors that look like everything we try to reproduce today. 

And there is also something wonderful about the old pubs, the locals sharing a beer at the bar with their friends (it was packed that day, I just took photos at the rare moments when the tables emptied) their dogs, their muddy boots and the warmth of it all... 

I discovered the Sunday Roast tradition when I moved to England and it's one of my favourite things. For the food, but also for the vibe.

12488328,garancedore,C2z2FdytfSF,True,"The first time I went to Bath, it was just a short visit but I remember vividly saying to Graham that I could see myself live there. He had agreed. A few years later (I tell all that story in my newsletter in the link in bio!) completely by accident, I found and fell in love with a house which turned out to be in the countryside of... Bath. 

So here I am sharing with you my favourite places as a new local. Bath is a bit over an hour train from London, super easy but If you ever visit, take some time to drive around Somerset as well, it's just gorgeous!

It's a very walkable city with a lot of fabulous views, and mentionned in my reel are... 

Locations-

The Royal Crescent and The Circus and a few of the world famous locations that you'll find just by walking around. 

Food

@landraceupstairs , a gorgeous restaurant just above a gorgeous bakery. @beckfordcanteen and @beckfordbottleshop , delicious and welcoming. And our coffee absolute favourite, @colonnacoffee (their cakes and pastries are delicious)

Stores 

@berdoulat_interior_design is a must see, interior decoration in one of the most beautiful settings (it's original too!) I've ever seen. @8hollandstreet is where all my furniture dreams are and we've already talked about the magic of @devolkitchens ! I also love Bartlett Antique Center and still can't believe such beautiful antiques are so affordable. 

A special mention to @toppingsbath , a bookstore I really fell in love with and could spend hours in. There is a very special vibe there, I always leave with a ton of books!

@persephonebooks for r√©√©ditons of books written by women and @magalleriabath for the coolest magazines on the planet, a very passionate project!

All right I'll probably be back with more but I was dying to take you on a quick tour. Save it for when you'll come visit!
