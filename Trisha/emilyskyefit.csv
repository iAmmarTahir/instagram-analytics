544581347,emilyskyefit,C3pVoXFBnrF,False,"Sharing this scares the sh*t outta me, but here goes…😬🫣

I’ve always felt like I’m “strange” & misunderstood, & have never felt I belong in the world. I’m super sensitive, think differently, overthink, catastrophize, hyper focus & have multiple thoughts at the same time NON-STOP. Daily tasks at times are impossible for me, & sometimes just stepping out of the house feels terrifying. 

I’ve just been diagnosed with ADHD & RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) - which explains why I people-please so much & get so upset when faced with rejection, or even the perception of it - which tends to be my default reaction!

The fear of rejection is paralyzing at times, hindering me from taking action. It’s likely the reason I place immense pressure on myself to achieve perfection... a goal that is unattainable & often leads to more distress, ultimately resulting in inaction.

Throughout my life, I’ve carried the belief that I am broken, incompetent, & unintelligent, harboring deep self-hatred as a result. 😢 The burden of guilt & resentment towards myself has been overwhelming.

Living within my own mind for the past 39 years has been undeniably exhausting, at times making me wish I could escape my own thoughts. I’ve long been aware that I don’t fit the mold of what is considered “neurotypical” & I’ve found relief & validation in officially getting a diagnoses. I can now help myself & show self compassion. 🙌🏼

I am so thankful for my family & true friends who accept & love me no matter what. 🙏🏼 I’m especially grateful for Dec, who has stood by my side for the past 14 years, despite the challenges of living with me. It still surprises me that he wants to marry me haha! 😆

I am also grateful for the decision to start exercising in my 20s, as it is the one consistent factor that helps me tremendously.

ADHD & RSD do NOT define me, nor do they render me broken. I am wonderfully unique, just like every individual in this world. I believe there is no such thing as “normal” anyway. 🥰🫶🏼

If you feel comfortable sharing, have you received a neurodivergent diagnosis as an adult?

We are not alone. 😘

544581347,emilyskyefit,C2zHhUYhzhC,True,"“You’re meant to be a fitness professional, but you’re weak, unfit & pathetic!“ - these are not words from other people, they’re words from my own head! 😫 Yep, I can be my own worst enemy! 😔 Words have great power & we need to be careful what we tell ourselves. 
I’m actively working on reprogramming the way I talk to myself to be more positive, kinder & more encouraging. I need to believe in myself as I believe it’s the first & most important step towards achieving success!
This workout absolutely destroyed me. 🥵 But I did it & I’m proud of myself! 👏🏼
Getting back into my training has been a struggle. I’m lacking motivation & consistency feels like a distant dream. I’ve been beating myself up over the strength & fitness I’ve lost. Rehabbing injuries for several months has left me feeling discouraged, & it’s hard not to compare myself to who I used to be.

Fitness professionals like me are not immune to struggles. We may know WHAT to do, but we still have to put in the work for results. The mental game is the toughest part, especially when starting over feels like a never-ending cycle. Life throws curveballs that make it hard to stick with something long-term. But I’m determined to reclaim my fitness, strength, & get back to feeling incredible again.

Negative self-talk doesn’t do us any good. Deep down, we know this, but we need reminders. We have to consciously choose to focus on the positive, even when it feels like an uphill battle. It’s not easy, but it’s necessary.

Remember; If it were easy, everyone would be doing it. The path to fitness is tough, but it’s worth every bit of effort. So I’m taking charge, setting realistic goals, & celebrating every small victory along the way. Consistency is my anchor, & I’m committed to showing up for myself every single day.

It does get easier, I know this because I’ve done it many times before. Each day I put in the effort, I know I’ll get stronger & fitter. Progress may be slow, but it’s progress nonetheless. 
Let’s embrace the struggle, be proud of our efforts, & keep pushing forward.
