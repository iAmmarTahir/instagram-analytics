Midnight Flame 7 has a Copper/Red tone and if you apply it on lighter levels with less red underlying pigment you will see more copper. If you apply it on lower levels with more depth then you will see more red since lower levels has more red background. Always understand color theory so it helps you formulate to achieve your end result.

Natural coppers are easily created using the NEW MidnightFlame7 shade. You can Custom mix your own potency. The pigment is rich with dyeload. This one shade does it all so you can maximize your inventory space while getting the best performance you can depend on.

üî•NakedGlow is a Gold/Blush Beige tone allowing the hair 
To be bright and golden and as you lift the hair with permanent color you will expose a copper undertone so adding a touch of MidnightFlame to the formula really gives a soft boost of natural ginger red tone. 
Using only TwilightDream7 at the root√†ge prevents hot roots since hair lifts copper anyways. TwilightDream7 is a Brown/WarmGold base so it really supplement the end result we needed.
