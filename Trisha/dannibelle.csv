As you know, I‚Äôm a tall gal so I have to eat quite a lot of protein to help build muscle. It‚Äôs important to include a source of protein in each of your main meals but I find adding extra snacks helps get me to my target (usually aiming to hit around 150 grams of protein per day).

15404271,dannibelle,C33Yr7cSd-N,False,"I‚Äôve been involved in sports and fitness since I was 8 years old when I began training and competing in track and field athletics.

I played so many different sports throughout my ilife, competitively and socially. I trained for sport and I trained for fitness. 

When I first stepped foot in the gym I was TERRIFIED. I had no idea what I was doing, I had no plan, no goals and no confidence to comfortably train in front of people. 

I may have had years of experience training in the field I knew (athletics) but when it came to strength training, I had no idea. I wish I had more guidance and knew what I do now to cut out years of misguided advice and following fads.

Strength training changed my life. I got introduced to it when I was at my weakest having just returned home from modelling placement. It has changed my mind, health, attitude, work ethic, confidence and career. 

Everyones fitness journey is going to look different. Different schedules, struggles, goals and motivations. I know how it feels to want to achieve something but not sure how to get there. 

Working closely with clients and helping them on their fitness journey makes me so happy, I‚Äôve decided to offer custom coaching to a limited number of clients. Intake will open March 4th and close March 22nd.

15404271,dannibelle,C3QkT7APLRf,False,"Have you ever looked back at a time in your life where you wished you had just slowed down and enjoyed it a little more? There have been many times that I wish I had been a little less preoccupied with the unnecessary nonsense that seemed to have consumed me and focused more on enjoying the present. I think back to when I was younger, I think of all the BS fad diets I tried, the stress I would put myself through to weigh less or meet some unrealistic standards for my body. I think of the things I kept wanting to change in myself and the comparisons I would make to others. 

But you know what, when I think back to those days, I don‚Äôt remember what I weighed, I don‚Äôt remember when I had visible abs or when I had a little extra padding. I remember creating memories with my family, I remember creating, travelling, meeting incredible people from all around the world and making lifelong friends. I remember all the special things that can so easily escape us on the day-to-day basis but I didn‚Äôt have a single fond memory that was associated with being restrictive or obsessive when it came to body image. 

Funnily enough the moment I decided to stop focusing on purely the aesthetic side of fitness I achieved what I wanted as a by-product of enjoying the process and getting stronger.

15404271,dannibelle,C3GVLVky6-c,True,"3 Reasons your glutes aren‚Äôt going üçë

Building muscle is hard work and takes time. You have to be patient and consistent to see results. Here are some reasons you may not be seeing results and how to overcome them: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ Inadequate Training Volume or Intensity:

Issue: Building muscle requires adequate training stimulus. If you‚Äôre not training with enough intensity (upping your weights and training close to failure for at least your first compound lift) your glutes may not be receiving the necessary stimulation to grow.

Solution: Focus on increasing the intensity of your workouts by increasing the weight you‚Äôre lifting, incorporate progressive overload and include more glute-focused exercises in your routine. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Inadequate Nutrition or Recovery:

Issue: Not fuelling your body properly and overtraining can hinder your results. 

Solution: Muscles need proper nutrition and recovery to grow. If you‚Äôre not consuming enough calories, particularly protein, your body may lack the essential building blocks for muscle growth. Additionally, inadequate rest and recovery can hinder progress. Make sure you‚Äôre getting enough quality sleep, managing stress and allowing your muscles to recover between workouts.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Not following a structured program 

Issue: Changing your workouts every session isn‚Äôt going to help you build your glutes.It can be tempting to jump on the latest glute building trend or exercise that promises to build your glutes after 1 session but the reality is that building your glutes takes time and requires you to perform the same workouts for at least 4 - 6 weeks, progressively increasing the intensity (progressive overload). 

Solution: Following a program that incorporates progressive overload and has a well structured exercise selection will help you maximise your gains.

It‚Äôs important to note that each persons nutritional requirement looks different. I‚Äôm 5ft 11‚Äù and need to consume a metric shit ton (official form of measurement) of protein to help me build muscle because I am 90% limbs ü§ù

I don‚Äôt cut or bulk and I don‚Äôt restrict myself either.

You see the biggest changes through consistency and it‚Äôs easy to be consistent when your approach to fitness is balanced and sustainable and most of all when you actually enjoy it.
