Meet Dan Rubin. Photographer, film-maker, creative director and friend of Trakke.

You’ve probably seen Marc at work — even if you don’t know it yet — on Britain’s Got Talent or America’s Got Talent as his alter-ego, Magician X (@iammagicianx), leading to incredible success online and off, and hundreds of millions of fans around the world.

We spent an afternoon at Marc’s home studio in London chatting about our shared love of sci-fi, special effects, cognitive psychology, and design (among his many talents, Marc is a trained illustrator and graphic designer), and of course, magic.

Marc is, unsurprisingly, a talented wordsmith, and one thing he said keeps running circles around my head in the days since our chat, as it applies to so many human endeavours: “Anything is possible if you put your mind to it, and you have to have that mindset because ultimately what you’re trying to create is something that should not exist.” Brilliant.

His story is as captivating as his illusions — read more from our chat at the link on my profile, and check out Marc and Magician X on Instagram and YouTube for more magic.

Whenever I’m about to head back to Vienna, I get a happy pang similar to homesickness (appropriately, there is a word in German for exactly this: “fernweh”); a place I was planning to call home before the pandemic (and Brexit) interrupted, I’m still aiming to make it at least a part-time home one day.

Looking back on these images from February 2020 feels a bit dreamlike — news outlets were buzzing about COVID-19 during my visit. I remember being surprised that there were no border restrictions upon my return to London, as the first confirmed cases in Austria had been discovered the day of my flight.

That trip was full of promise and excitement for things to come: a full Spring & Summer of travel, workshops, documentary filmmaking, and commissions; a few months in Fall set aside for apartment-hunting in Vienna; years of planning, preparing, and patience all coming to fruition.

Though the last 4 years haven’t exactly played out how I imagined (ha!), each return to Vienna feels like a mini-reset back to that pre-pandemic energy and momentum.

Hope to see some of you at Wednesday’s mini-workshop and photowalk — link in the usual places ✌🏼

72,danrubin,C10vRKTCvZ2,False,"More views from Vienna, this time from October 2023 on the new Phoenix color film.

The last few years have been (mostly) good for analog photography: the new Leica M6, increased use of ECN-2 film stocks and processing, news of a new line of Pentax film cameras — while we’re also facing rising film prices and ongoing economic issues elsewhere, I’ll take positive news when it comes.

When Phoenix was released, there was a certain amount of negativity about who was sent sample rolls as the launch coverage and reviews rolled out. The common complaint was that it was only sent to “influencers” — not a term I love, though people with influence have always been a good strategy for getting the word out.

The implication was that if Phoenix had been sent to “real” photographers for testing, the images would have been better, or the reviews wouldn’t have been as favorable, etc. — and that the generally-positive public feedback on the new film was only due to said influencers not wanting to get on Harman’s bad side.

This sort of commentary smells like jealousy, and I get it — there are a LOT of amazing photographers out there who haven’t been blessed by social media’s algorithmic deities, and it can be frustrating to see opportunities being handed to other people when you feel you could do better. However, indignance doesn’t do anyone any favors.

It’s also easy to be jaded, and say companies like @harmanphoto are making a money-grab by selling a limited edition product — though I’d wager most of the folks who made that argument happily took advantage of Black Friday deals.

Harman launched a new, niche product, and you can’t do that without promotion — if you can get the bulk of your press by sending people free product, more power to you.

So, let people be excited about new film! The world has enough darkness right now — choose to shine a light where you can.

This time we’re digging into high-speed B&W film (3200ISO, pushing film, and the like), so I thought I’d share some images I’ve been sitting on for a while.

In February 2020, I was in Vienna for a few weeks and brought along a camera I’d had in my collection for years but never used: a Kodak Retina 1a from 1953.

I slowly captured a single roll of HP5+ while wandering Vienna’s streets, zone focusing at f11–16, pushing the roll 1-stop (effectively turning 400ISO film into 800ISO) to keep the shutter speeds higher at those smaller apertures.

I’ll share some more from this roll in a few days — it’ll be nice to revisit Vienna on high-speed B&W film nearly 4 years on 🎞️

72,danrubin,C1PfJ4Bi-o3,True,"This last tip in the current smartphone photography series seems obvious once you know it: When using devices with multiple lenses, use the exact focal length (or multiplier, e.g. 2×, 3×, etc.) to Zoom with the highest quality.

Newer devices will of course give you amazing images throughout their zoom range, but just as in the days of single-lens smartphones, cropping an image slightly will provide better quality than zooming the same amount.

72,danrubin,C1NTn30i8bV,True,"White Balance (sometimes called “Color” or “Temperature” depending on your software) is a key tool when editing any image, regardless of the lighting conditions. As smart as our devices are, it’s possible for a photo to need correction if it looks different than what our eyes see — or you may want your subject to be warmer or cooler for effect. Either way, White Balance is important to understand and use.
