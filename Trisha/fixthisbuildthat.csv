641094411,fixthisbuildthat,Czckl4RLIZ7,False,"Wow, hard to believe this, but I started this Instagram account 10 years ago today. It all started when I wanted to share some woodworking projects online and found some like minded peeps. 

And I don't know when this Pic was from, but I was pretty stoked about 50 followers! üòÇüòÇ

2.5 years later I went full time content. Running my own content business has been the hardest and most rewarding job I've ever had. 

It's changed the trajectory of not only my life, but my family's lives too. Working side by side with my wife (Susan) from our house has strengthened our relationship (through struggle üòÇ) and give me so much more time with our kids.

And if you're reading this you've likely been along for the ride. Maybe as a passerby over the years or a hardcore supporter who's been around for years and loved hanging out on the Lives. Either way, thank you. Without people on the other end watching and enjoying our content the business doesn't exist.

It's been a heck of a 10 year journey, and in some ways I feel like we're still just getting started. And we can't wait to continue the ride with you guys/gals. 

Here's to another 10!

641094411,fixthisbuildthat,CyD4137Law2,False,"I‚Äôve been putting in a lot of work on the shop renovation and we‚Äôve got a lot of material to move around including framing lumber, OSB, and a ton of bagged insulation. It‚Äôs not light work, but I enjoy the hard work and just putting my head down and going. @timberlandpro sent me their Morphix 5-Pocket Athletic pants and Morphix 6‚Äù Outdoor Boot to check out and I‚Äôve been wearing them on the job.

The Morphix line is lightweight and flexible which I LOVE in workwear. I‚Äôm not a fan of the big stiff canvas type work pants. The pants have some clever features like a tape measure guard, doubled up cuffs so your boots don‚Äôt tear them up, and an extra little loop for your EDC to hang from.

And the boots are also flexible and lightweight with composite safety toes and waterproofing. They‚Äôre comfortable too which I assume comes from their Hover Spring midsole. If you‚Äôve been looking for something more flexible and athletic that‚Äôs still tough then give these a look, link in my bio.
