Ingredients 
2 servings of basmati rice, (about 100g / 3.5 oz) rinsed 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
Small chunk of ginger, (about 20g / 0.7 oz) cut into matchsticks/grated 
2 large cloves garlic, thinly sliced 
1 tablespoon tamari 
100g / ¾ cup / 3.5 oz frozen peas, defrosted 
100g / ¾ cup / 3.5 oz frozen edamame beans, defrosted 
Pinch of sea salt 

For the sticky tofu 
1 tablespoon olive oil 
1 block firm smoked tofu, (about 280g / 10 oz) drained & cut into bite-sized pieces 
1 tablespoon tamari 
2 tablespoons maple syrup 
2 tablespoons brown rice miso paste 
2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar 

Method  

Pour the rice into a small saucepan, along with 200ml / 7 fl oz water and a large pinch of salt. Bring to the boil, then cover with a lid, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and set aside. 
 
While the rice is cooking, warm 1 tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan set over medium–high heat. Add the tofu and cook for 10 minutes, stirring often, until crisp and golden on all sides. 
 
Next, whisk together 1 tablespoon tamari, the maple syrup, miso paste and rice wine vinegar. Once the tofu is cooked, pour the sauce into the pan and let it reduce to create a sticky sauce that coats the tofu. Remove the tofu from the pan and set aside on a plate. 
 
Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the same pan, followed by the cooked rice, ginger and garlic. Fry for 5 minutes, until crisp, then stir in the tamari, peas, edamame beans and crispy tofu. Divide between 2 bowls and serve with your favourite crispy chilli oil/sauce.

Never in a million years did I think I’d start a business or stand among such an inspiring group of female founders. So, moments like this feel very special and act as real markers of what we’ve built at DE.

Deliciously Ella has been built by our team, no one achieves great things alone. That team has always been made of mostly of extraordinary women though, with 5 out of 7 of our senior leadership team being women and Matthew consistently acting as the ultimate champion of female success, inspired by his mothers career.

286342232,deliciouslyella,C3ic3C1IQO-,True,"I’m making this on repeat at the moment, so wanted to share the recipe with you. It’s a family favourite, such a good staple and one of the easiest ways to up your veggie intake. It’s a nice one for food waste too, simply swap the veg for anything you’ve got lying around at home - leeks, whole tomatoes, courgettes, leafy greens etc are all delicious additions, likewise white beans instead of chickpeas and any pasta shape instead of orecchiette (broken pieces of lasagne are fab, as is orzo). Dial the chilli up or down to taste, or simply add it at the end if you’re making this for little ones (once you’ve served them) 

For the nourishing veggie broth with orecchiette, you’ll need 
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 2 carrots, halved lengthways & cut into 1cm half moons
- 2 sticks of celery, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, crushed/finely chopped
- 2 bay leaves
- small handful of thyme sprigs
- 1 tablespoon tomato purée
- 1 tablespoon brown rice miso paste
- 1 x 400g tin chopped tomatoes
- 1 x 400g tin chickpeas, drained
- 1¼ litre vegetable stock
- 3 servings of orecchiette (about 225g)
- large handful of basil
- pinch of dried red chilli flakes
- pinch of sea salt

1. Warm the olive oil in a large deep saucepan or casserole dish set over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, a pinch of salt and cook for 5 minutes until slightly softened.

2. Stir in the bay leaves, thyme leaves, tomato purée and miso; cook for 2–3 minutes until fragrant. 

3. Next, pour in the tinned tomatoes, chickpeas and stock. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10–15 minutes until the vegetables are tender. 

4. Remove the pan from the heat and use a hand blender to roughly blitz half of the soup to thicken it slightly (if you like), then return to the heat, add the pasta and cook for 8–10 minutes until al dente. 

5. Divide between bowls and scatter over the basil, chilli flakes (if using) and a drizzle of olive oil
