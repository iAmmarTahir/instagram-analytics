1558709069,everlook_photography,CUwrOVBPqrO,False,"Hi all ! I'm back at my editing PC going through the images from Tasmania. In choosing which image to edit first, I guess first impressions count! We were so excited to see snow from the aeroplane as we were flying in and Kunanyi did not disappoint. I hiked up South Wellington on the first dawn of the trip and eventually found my way to the Rocking Stone where I struggled with a frozen tripod and cold hands but managed to get this composition among a few others. It was the first series of shots taken with NiSi s new V7 filter holder of which I had a prototype to try out. Only a polariser was used for this image as I had to resist a temptation to shoot into the blazing sun to the left! 

Stay tuned for more images from our trip :) #nisifilters #nisifiltersanz @nisiglobal @nisifiltersaustralia #australia #seeaustralia #tasmania #discoverearth #discovertasmania #hobart #kunanyi #mountwellington #rockingstone #dawn #sunrise #landscape #nature #winter #everlookphotography",36,2423,1633680876,"{'id': '1074174402716395', 'has_public_page': True, 'name': 'Kunanyi', 'slug': 'kunanyi'}",https://scontent-lhr6-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/245010101_172543318385793_4982146485714790704_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr6-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=ypJIFY7ulYwAX-3u2El&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBjOennZd8T6-pm5r5E-1eUWxyCE50JT_xwkV5ehvlJ6w&oe=65E7DB5E&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
