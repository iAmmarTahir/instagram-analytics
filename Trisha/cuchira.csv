During the time I’ve been with my husband my body has seen many changes. Seemingly subtle ones that speak loud as women’s bodies do in all our many stages. These are changes that a superficial mind conditioned by a skin-deep culture would label as not attractive. I remember my EX-husband being disgusted by my armpit & random nipple hairs which I thought was hilarious, after all women have testosterone helping us produce new blood cells, maintain bone health, libido & boost other reproductive hormones. I’ve been learning more about hormone changes as I approach menopause which is incredibly fascinating & always reiterates to me how wise the body is in adapting throughout its phases. 

The body is a book that reads of its lifetime. Birthmarks, scars, aging marks, wrinkles, tattoos, spots, hair loss, stretch marks, some of us lose limbs or gain “extra” parts along the journey. The book of the body is beautiful in its creativity. It tells a rich story. Looking at a dead body is captivating in a way, being that the soul has left its shell. It’s like an artifact left behind with stories of the past written on its skin. A tangible object the soul crafted while here on earth. But the beauty of an alive body is that the soul is still inhabited & can continue to write. Creating until its very last day. I want my body to be a museum when my soul leaves it. 

Often my clients are surprised that I know so many intimate details about their inner world without them having to tell me.  They say “how did you know that?” “It’s like you’re inside me!” “You were saying what I was thinking as I was thinking it! How do you know that?” Well, I’ve read a lot of bodies in my lifetime & it’s my gift (one could say). I’m a body bookworm or a somatic scholar. The beauty of the way the body reads is that it doesn’t lie like the mind does. It’s vulnerable (even if you think you’re not). It’s incapable of lying; just like an aged body cannot look young no matter how hard you or your plastic surgeon try to turn back time. That’s what I find stunning about aging & my work as a somatic healer. It’s honest AF & the Scorpio in me doesn’t do casual or roundabout.",3,122,1709393795,,https://instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/430706855_18416960263033893_447777874578983194_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flhr13-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=109&_nc_ohc=GJakeB1fZ6MAX_SGwWb&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfAk17To-LEYaooSSR5biR09xTbWS39FvQc1RP4FtlkQ-Q&oe=65E89BAE&_nc_sid=8b3546,False
41057892,cuchira,C37irqsthhp,True,"I was asked if I could talk about my positive mindset towards aging: 

The older I get the smaller my ego becomes. As the persona dies I embrace my authentic self/true essence more (what people describe as “more comfortable in your own skin”).Not placing so much attention on the superficial I have loads of time/mind/energy space to be without the “noise”. It’s an ALWAYS VACATION. But most of my comfort is directly linked to my comfort with death. The reason our culture is so afraid of getting old is because they are afraid of death. So we don’t talk about death, we talk about aging when we should be talking about death. 

There are many reasons why people fear death. Where do we go? What happens? We imagine the worst. There are those (including myself) that have had near death experiences & have crossed the veil which gives us a sneak peek into the other-side BUT unless you know someone that was straight dead & has come back to share the mystery… The mystery remains & that’s what freaks people out & fascinates me so. Our brains are wired to reduce uncertainty & death is the epitome of uncertainty which is why life’s greatest practice is to get comfortable with the uncomfortable which in essence is practicing death. 

But think of it in this way; Look at history & our current world. War. Pain. Struggle. Hurt. Greed. Violence. It’s all fucked. And we think the other-side is scary?! That makes me LOL! Life isn’t easy & it’s purposefully designed that way! The longer you live the more of a chance you get to get comfortable with the uncomfortable, that means embracing aging (death). That is if you understand that’s what life is for. If you don’t aging will become the living death you fear & it will become your reality. The more you repress the process the more the fear virus will spread within you. The more you embrace it the more “life” you get.

41057892,cuchira,C30XtYqNIFv,False,"ANNIVERSARY 5

2yrs into a divorce that crushed my spirit & stole the ground from underneath me I was finally coming out of the biggest inner battle of my life. I was starting to feel “in my body” again, content in my celibacy & happy to stay solo for the rest of my life so of course the universe throws unconditional love at me via the sexiest vessel I’d ever seen. “His name is Ruben. He’s made for you. Take it or leave it” said the Universe. Oh I took it (for a day 😜)& then I left it, answering back to the universe “if you want me to take it FOREVER you’ll show me the way”. 

FUK ME if she did! 9 months after meeting him I moved from the 🇺🇸➡️🇵🇹. 3 months later we were married & bought our 1st apartment. Today married 5yrs. The wedding had at the local municipality in flip flops & converse followed up with açaí at our favorite spot. That ease & comfort continues to guide us through the healthiest, happiest, most passionate relationship ever possible! 

I didn’t want to get married again nor was I looking for a soulmate. I was focused on getting me back after being completely obliterated in my ex-marriage. I fed myself all the love & by that I mean I got down, dirty, ugly & real. I faced every face of my-self & took responsibility (ACTION)! 

When my mind-spirit-body got healthy-happy on my own dime I was able to reflect healthy-happy back into the world. You see, Ruben had been doing the work as well before meeting me. If we had met even a month before the most magical day of our lives the universe would have said “Nope. Keep at it kids.” That’s why searching for love in another without the doing the self-work doesn’t work. Find IT in yourself & the love will reflect back NATURALLY. The beauty is that the love will reflect back FOREVER with EASE because it is based in honesty & respect from the root of where it began… in you.

41057892,cuchira,C3pZUQ8tXqf,False,"I was talking to a man the other day & his eyes kept skimming over to a huge patch of gray hair growing strong from my roots. Fascinating watching his thoughts as he kept the casual conversation going with his eyes fixed on my gray. I heard my inner voice say “cool ol’ lady huh?” 

I’ve been completely mesmerized by my beauty as I age. I say this not in vanity but in the sheer wonderment of watching my body slowly decay. I find the life to death cycle absolutely stunning; not only in humans but in all organisms. The way my skin has softened, age spots appearing, lips thinned, the wrinkle between my brow more pronounced, neck sagging…. goodness it’s fucking sexy! Nothing more beautiful to me than a woman who lounges in her skin with confidence & pleasure. I wouldn’t go back to my youth if you paid me! With every new chin hair that grows thicker I celebrate my life! 

The beauty of getting older besides the obvious of giving zero fucks is that I’m 100% involved in every change that happens in my body. The changes are bigger & more frequent, the body has a lots more opinions on how it’s treated & it too gives zero fucks when it comes to showing off it’s age: trigger finger, rotator cuffs tears, pre-menopausal aches & sweats, random old funky surprises that make me say, “now what!?” 

It’s always something & the recovery rate a lot slower BUT it forces my ass to get up & go on a long walk, jogs, resistance training, stretching, hot/cold therapy, healthy diet, emotional somatic cleansing MovMEANT EVERY SINGLE DAY!

I don’t fear death. I highly respect it, as much as I respect life. For that reason I cherish my time on earth & when I die I’d like to go OLD. REALLY OLD. So old they think I’m already dead yet I can rock a solid pull up 😂

How have the foundational teachings come to hurt or help you now? You see this video ⬆️ This was a big part of my OF. Started at 5yrs old. Olympian by 15. Professional dancer in my 20’s & 30’s. Somatic healing from 5 to my current 47. Discipline is the greatest tool I learned from the foundational teaching of my somatic “career”. THE DISCIPLINE never allowed the healing & connection to body-self stray for too long. I always returned to it one way or another either by choice or necessity. MovMEANT isn’t something I do any longer to impress or for ego. It’s my fucking sanity, the original foundation planted from day one! It could give 2fucks if it looks good or if I do it the “right” way. It’s no longer for vanity. In fact nothing about me is. Life has a way of conditioning us (particularly women, women athletes, women in the entertainment industry as I was all of those) that we have to look, be, move a certain way. It took me a long time to uncondition myself from all the BS. I’m loving my grays & the way my neck skin gets soft & wobbles when I turn my neck. If you’re not wobbly & wiggly something ain’t right! Point being, the original foundation still holds this ol’ ship up solid even if the seas are turbulent. Everybody’s foundation holds wisdom. You just gotta write & live by the narrative that serves best. I could choose to see my narrative as the athlete as the little girl who starved & survived emotional & psychological abuse, or I could see it as the beastmode warrior that never let anyone fuck with her spirit & always stayed true to her authenticity while getting some serious gains. I choose the second & that helps me thrive even today.

SHE. The savage one. Wild, raw, ferocious, untamed. That which she is & always was. That no experience or other can take from her for it is her blood. Cut her open and the fox will come out to play; mischievous, adaptable, playful, resilient, clever. SHE is the one THEY fear yet admire from afar as she dances in her unabashed freedom. Judge her and you will only reflect your own fears. Watch her for a while and she will make you scold away any bit of repression. Words like ugly, pretty, crazy, sexy, stupid are just but passing sound waves to dance too. Names are one dimensional. Stories are boring. Labels are the illusion that anything can be defined. Presence is potent and potency is her magic. It’s all an open void she can paint expression and movement vomit on. Her most intimate companion is her mortality. The acknowledgement of her death allows her to live unabashed NOW. SHE is in all of us, just for most she’s hidden by a veil of fear. Drop the veil so the fox can play free.

41057892,cuchira,C3aDu6Btfg1,False,"CREATIVITY IS THE GREATEST HEALING TOOL

I give a lot of credit to my creativity in terms of my healing abilities in myself & in guiding others. Creativity is the greatest facet to human intelligence & consciousness. There’s no greater tool than creativity when it comes to EVERYTHING. 

Just look at the world we’ve created through our creativity. We generate all sorts of new ideas, continual advancement, solve all sorts of problems & make phenomenal works of art that move us, connect us & help us express & communicate the wordless parts of us. Yet I’ve found that when it comes to healing trauma, reconnecting energetically, getting past our emotional wounds, the power of creativity gets overlooked or even laughed at. 

The brain says “why are we playing around making art when you’re in pain?” Well brain to answer your question: because through abstract expression & creative sourcing I discombobulate your narrative & give myself an outlet of energy, thus giving IT a voice instead of you continuously reciting the same ol’ wack narrative that keeps me stuck! 

Creativity is empowering. The fearful brain doesn’t want you playing around with new ideas. It wants you safe & sound staying in its “known” state so it doesn’t have to be left in some weird unknown where it can’t “protect” you. But the body wants to express itself freely. They both have good intentions & find themselves disagreeing. The brain is the more careful fearful parent; the body the free-spirited parent. The compromise is in creativity. Safe enough for the brain, adventurous enough for the body, giving you TONS of options on how to approach the problem(s). 

Where we tend to get stuck in our healing is that we always go the same route, ending up at the same point. Creativity gives you different routes, new scenery, new possibilities, different end points. A huge part of my practice & work with my clients is focused on creativity. How can we give the same old story a boost & reboot? How can we turn the boring old mind dance into a new & exciting vibrant masterpiece? MovMEANT.com for a whole new perspective on healing.

Have you heard it sing at the top of its lungs without a care in the world. Heard it laugh exuberantly to the point where your belly hurts so good.

It’s been quite the 2 weeks as we figure out what’s going on with Ganchos health. He’s now stable. Seemingly at peace as we wait for the exam results to understand more of what’s going on in his little body. Once again, as the universe does so well, she’s testing me. Luckily I’ve been consistent with my practice of BEING in awareness, feeling the feels, emoting the emotions & flushing the residue of my internal happenings before they grab hold & throw me around. Not this time. Showing up is showing up for me right now.

In the past my worrying mind would’ve hijacked me to the point of immobility. After years of learning how to not fear my pain, or overindulge in it, I’ve found the sweet spot where all my emotions can sit at the table & have a productive cordial conversation without freaking the FUK out. In the past worry would have annihilated everyone else at the table. Now all my feelings/emotions can mingle mindfully with each other to reach a reasonable, respectable & manageable compromise for the good of every emotion that lives in my vessel.

This emotional wisdom did not come easily. I’ve invested a lot of time & effort to get to where I am now in body-mind-spirit. This is crucial work. This is why we are here. To learn. To evolve. To receive the lessons & give back. Gancho is the Angel on the ground dishing out homework from the universe. I appreciate the universe’s tests and proceed onwards with gratitude for all ❤️

41057892,cuchira,C3IX1JNNDRy,True,"Feelings are our friends. I know some will roll their eyes & be like “yeah right”. Feelings can feel like the enemy but it’s only because you’re taking it personally. Have you ever tried listening & observing the feelings as a witness or vessel instead of the persona of which they are happening to? It won’t feel like an attack but an important message. Because it is. 

Imagine not having feelings. Btw, repressing feelings isn’t NOT having feelings. Repressed feelings still live in you, even louder in-fact. I’d say it’s the opposite of not having feelings. Repression/suppression amplifies the feelings, it does not rid you of them. By doing so you’re only building a stronger army inside you. 

There is no person without feelings. Those are called robots. To feel is to be alive. Feelings are essential, vital information you need to communicate with your inner & outer worlds. They help us survive, grow, adapt, connect. When you don’t allow them to speak you’re left lost in the world without your emotional GPS. The feelings only scream louder, the emotions move stronger in you. Suppress more & they’ll stop nudging & start fighting. Cage them up for long enough & they’ll start rotting in you. Disease. 

All they wanted was to let you know they had something important to tell you cause they care about you. If you didn’t agree at least you could have had a conversation with them instead of locking them away. Sitting & talking to your feelings is the most important conversation you’ll ever have. Learn how they speak & you’ll want them around more often.
