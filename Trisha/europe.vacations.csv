63237056581,europe.vacations,C3p3LZ6oO9a,False,"Santorini, the most magical of the Greek islands. This island of the Cyclades offers a multitude of activities to its visitors.

From discovering its historical heritage to watching the sunset over the Aegean Sea, to black sand beaches and boat trips, there is something for everyone. Here's a rundown of the best things to do in Santorini.

Fira, the capital, is one of the places not to be missed. With its white and blue houses, small cobbled streets, fashion boutiques and luxury hotels with swimming pools, it represents the essence of the island.

The village of Oia is also not to be missed for its spectacular beauty

The archaeological site of Akrotiri is an exciting getaway for history and culture lovers.

The ancient city of Thera is also worth a visit to learn more about the island's history

For food lovers, the Greek cuisine in Santorini is not to be missed, especially the famous souvlaki

Boat trips around the island are a pleasant way to discover the wonders of Santorini. The boat cruise, which allows you to visit the volcanic island and to reach the top of the crater of the volcano Nea Kameni, is a very popular activity

Sea kayaking from the red beach is also a fun activity that allows you to discover the volcanic coast and the fabulous sea caves

To finish the day, the sunset on Oia is one of the most famous activities in Santorini.

However, for those who are looking to watch the sunset from the water, the alignments may be better in Fira or Imerovigli.

63237056581,europe.vacations,C3nPIY9osdb,False,"Take a voyage back in time to Rothenburg, a medieval German town that is considered the most charming in Bavaria.

Rothenburg has a rich history that dates back to the Middle Ages. The town was founded in 1170 and thrived due to its strategic location on an important trade route. The town's historic buildings have been preserved in their original state and offer visitors a unique glimpse into life in the Middle Ages.

Start by walking through the streets of the old town, admiring the historic buildings and beautiful views.

Be sure to visit the city hall, built in 1250, as well as climb the steps of the clock tower for a spectacular view of the city's rooftops, churches and historic buildings.

Last but not least, don't miss a visit to the medieval fortress called Burggarten, which also offers a breathtaking view of the city. It's the perfect place to take memorable pictures.
