This may be the best brunch experience in Toronto. Chef Bri is full of incredible energy and immense culinary skill. 

These Chicken & Waffles were perfect. Tender, crispy and flavourful Chicken, paired with perfectly made Waffles and a sweet and spicy Habanero Syrup. 

Stay tuned for more delicious content from this incredible Brunch, cuz I have more to share.

We all know that no event celebrates the spirit of competition like the Super Bowl. And we all know that food is a major part of that event. 

But did you know that there is a an even fiercer competition that has been going on between food lovers even before the first Super Bowl was played?

This battle is the battle for wing supremacy. Drums or Flats. The debate over which is the better bite is more intense than any football fans love for their favorite team and their despising of their rivals. 

So I got some @pintysfoods wings and two of my favourite chefs to battle it out by making the most appetizing Super Bowl spreads possible. 

We had a drafts, wing related trivia, and a lot of food and a lot of fun. Check it out!!!
