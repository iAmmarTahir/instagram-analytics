@terbumurph flew in to help me, and though we‚Äôd never done it before we were able to patch the edges of missing mortar and white wash the wall with a Venetian Glaze to brighten the room up a bit!

What do you think? Do you like the change or would you have left the stones as they were?

No one knows what the future holds for any of us, so instead of spending another second focusing on the things I can no longer do, I‚Äôm going to spend each day finding out what I CAN do and being extremely grateful for those things.

It‚Äôs pretty amazing that I was able to do any of the harder handstand skills I did with a decaying bone in my wrist, and I‚Äôm so grateful I was able to push it as hard as I did when I did.

I got an MRI recently that confirmed my fears, and the bone in my wrist that is decaying has started to fragment and other parts of my wrist are becoming affected now as well. I didn‚Äôt need imaging to tell me things were getting worse, I could feel it. The good news is I can still do a few handstands here and there for now and demo basic skills in classes, but I will no longer be training handstands regularly or pushing to advance my skills at all. 

There‚Äôs too much to say about all of this, so I‚Äôm not going to say much else right now. I‚Äôm so lucky because I have a lot of amazing things happening in my life that I can focus on, and I can continue sharing my love for handstands through teaching and my students. 

At this point all treatment options are experimental, but don‚Äôt worry I will definitely be over here getting whatever experiments done that I can üî¨

She has been teaching yoga for a long time and is very active, but her doctor recommended that she build more leg muscle.  She‚Äôs never really lifted weights (more than a few pound dumbbells), so we are building from the ground up with both compound and isolated exercises. 

We started with a standing warm up focusing on balance and leg mobility (I couldn‚Äôt film everything!)
Then we worked on hanging with supported hangs and scapular shrugs (grip strength is super important for older adults and also hanging is great for shoulder health + more)

3 x 10 Goblet Squats

2 x 10 Leg Extension Machine (single leg)
