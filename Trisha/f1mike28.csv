Never give up. There are always tough times, regardless of what you do in anything in life.
Be able to push through those times and maintain your ultimate goal.

I think you need to go through some stuff to really appreciate life and understand what it means to persevere, overcome and have faith. I think those tough times make you a stronger person.

17244915,f1mike28,CDRV3TSA-uJ,False,"Wear a smile and have friends, wear a scowl and have wrinkles. Too often we underestimate the power of a touch, a smile, a kind word, a listening ear, an honest compliment, or the smallest act of caring, all of which have the potential to turn a life around.

The happiness of life is made up of minute fractions the little, soon forgotten charities of a kiss or a smile, a kind look or heartfelt compliment.

A smile is the light in your window that tells others that there is a caring, sharing person inside.

Everything happens for a reason, and it builds character in us, and it tells us what we are about and how strong we really are when we didn't think we could be that strong.

Life is a journey and it's about growing and changing and coming to terms with who and what you are and loving who and what you are.

As a young boy I dreamed to work for @mercedesamg
I was fascinated from the Brand, the passion the two founders (Aufrecht and Melcher) had and the pure strength to get their dream come true! It had a huge impact on me to see nothing can stop you in life if you really want it!

As a young kid I wanted to follow into the footsteps of my great grandfather, grandfather and especially my dad who all worked 45 years for Daimler. But I never forgot my personal goal and this was AMG. On the weekends I drove to Affalterbach only to admire the cars and feel the the atmosphere there.

After years of working for Mercedes-Benz
I grabbed the chance and started working for AMG. I want to share here on Instagram how it feels to work for the Best Performance and Sports Car Brand in the world as an engine builder.

Sometimes it’s time to reflect how things can turn out in your life if you are ready to do it and work hard for it!
To be an engine builder for Mercedes-AMG is not only a job for me. It was my dream and now I can truly say, I am able to live my dream everyday. I really put all my heart and soul into my work.

It is a big honor for me to see the love, the passion for my work and the love for Mercedes-AMG you all share here with me.

Thank you to all the Ladies and Gentlemans all over the world with an engine handcrafted from me, to all AMG, Pagani customers and fans worldwide that share the passion and love for my work here on Instagram.

You all here make this Brand as special as it is to me. We all share so many moments together and became a big family. 
Thank you to all of you for that!

The rear design of the AMG GT R keeps its distinctive shape.

The AMG GT and AMG GT S are getting a new black grained sill cover on the bottom section. This makes for an extra-dynamic look. In conjunction with optional exterior packages, trim elements add individual highlights in high-gloss black, matt black, high-gloss chrome or carbon fibre.
Also, on request, the AMG GT and AMG GT S are available with a new y-spoke light-alloy wheel in matt black with a high-sheen finish.

17244915,f1mike28,C3sgvoxoS2b,False,"AMG GT Black Series „The Endgame“.

Back in the days, the most powerful AMG V8 series engine of all time, the most expressive design, the most elaborate aerodynamics, the most intelligent material mix, the most distinctive driving dynamics: For the new Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series (combined fuel consumption 12.8 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions 292 g/km)[1], the Affalterbach designers have pulled out all the stops when it comes to the art of vehicle design.

The super sports car perfectly embodies the brand’s rich tradition in motorsport, as well its many years of expertise in developing complete vehicles which impress in every respect. The result is an output of 537 kW (730 hp) from a V8 engine with a ‚flat‘ crankshaft, combined with active aerodynamics and a design which stems directly from the current AMG GT3 racing car.

Different designs of V8 engines.

The design of a V8 engine gives designers plenty of room to play with in one key element: the crank arrangement on the crankshaft.
The result is the most powerful V8 series engine from Mercedes-AMG.

The GT Black Series engine may be based on the AMG 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine with dry sump lubrication, but it has been given the new internal code M178 LS2 due to the numerous modifications. It achieves 730hp at 6700-6900 rpm and delivers a maximum torque of 800Nm at 2000-6000 rpm. New camshafts and exhaust manifolds are adapted to the new firing order and further improve the gas cycle.

Both twin scroll exhaust turbochargers are mounted in anti-friction bearings, as in the top-of-the-range four-door AMG GT Coupé, which optimises their throttle response even further. However, in the Black Series, the turbochargers have been given a larger compressor wheel, meaning that both can deliver a total of 1100 kg air per hour.
