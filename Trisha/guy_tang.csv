230726691,guy_tang,C0FVLO6y-rr,True,"So many of us are afraid to be ourselves and live our truth. This #song and #music video #Learn2Love is about the journey of self discovery and how it can make you feel lonely and isolated from everyone. Sometimes everything on the surface seems fine but below the surface is pain and you feel like you can‚Äôt breathe. Know that you‚Äôre not alone because I live that life for a very long time, afraid to be myself and what happens is you end up hurting everyone around you including yourself. It can take time for you to be ready to break through and have the strength to come out of darkness. I hope this song and video helps give you the confidence and strength to know your story can have a happy ending.

üåà Learn2Love is a sequel to my music video #Midnight and a prequel to my music video #SuperPower telling a true story of my life when I was in the closet. Most people don‚Äôt know I was actually in the closet til I was 28years old. I want to tell stories that helps anyone who is going through something that they are not alone and it‚Äôs ok to be afraid and when the timing is right they will find their identity and discover the magic of being theme selves.

Midnight Flame 7 has a Copper/Red tone and if you apply it on lighter levels with less red underlying pigment you will see more copper. If you apply it on lower levels with more depth then you will see more red since lower levels has more red background. Always understand color theory so it helps you formulate to achieve your end result.
