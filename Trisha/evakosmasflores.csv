I’m obsessed with these renderings of the space and the way the kitchen design came together from @strucksured 😍

We have made some changes since these were rendered over a year ago, but the general feel of the space remains the same. Warm, cozy, welcoming, and with big bright windows!

If anyone is curious, the changes were:

📝 White cabinets will be a light sage green color instead
📝 Hood vent will be sloped rather than straight
📝 We added some glass fronts to the cabinets on either side of the big window trio
📝 The drawer pulls were swapped for a more old-world-looking pull
📝 We added an arch to the doorway from the kitchen to the hallway

It’s been SO insane seeing this space take shape, bit by bit, right in front of me after imagining it for so many years. We started the design process for the house back in 2020, and in some ways it feels like it’s gone by in a flash, and in other ways it feels like it’s taken forever lol 😂

But I’m incredibly grateful that all the hard work has resulted in a real solid structure taking shape before our eyes!

I can’t wait to share more about budgeting for design choices in a blog post soon (working on it at the moment, hoping to have it up next week! 🤞) In the meantime, have a wonderful leap day my friend!!!

PS—Don’t let fear keep you from taking a wild, ridiculous leap. With some work + a dash of stubbornness, you never know where it might take you! 😊

As for me, I’ve been a bit quiet lately in terms of posting. There’s been some big projects going on that have taken up a lot of my time + energy, and I’m very excited to share more about them soon!

But suffice to say that between trying to get the house and garden projects in line to move this spring, and work projects, it’s been a busy time.

I still have a LOT more peonies to dig up (I knowwwww, it’s already late in the season to do that 😬), and I’ll be tackling the dahlia tubers next month with a group of amazing friends.

But little by little, things get done. I just have to keep sticking with it! 🙌

What about you, any home or garden projects going on in your present or future? 🏡

Here’s some of the varieties in the photos, if anyone is interested! 🌸

1. Elsa Saas peony
2. Lady Alexandra Duff peony
3. Josephine clematis
4. Victoire de la Marne peony
5. Baroness Schroeder peony

I’ve been sloooooowly digging up and potting the garden plants I want to take with me when we move. @resiliencedesign came over and helped me dig up my monster peony, which wouldn’t fit in a pot so Jeremy had to run to the store to get a giant plastic tub that we then drilled drainage holes into the bottom to get it to fit.

My plan is to take most of the peonies and dahlias with me, and some rosemary cuttings, currant berry cuttings, raspberry cuttings, rhododendron cuttings....well now that I am listing it out I can see I will have a very busy few months ahead of me 😅

Wishing you a beautiful day, my friends!! 🫶

34376011,evakosmasflores,C3QUKjPR4nS,False,"Where we ended up, and how we got there ➡️👀 I’m breaking down how I use layering to add dimension +  texture in captures, and you can get the full behind-the-scenes emailed to you by commenting LAYER below or via the link in my profile! 💌

And if you’re wondering what this golden concotion is, it’s a creamy and ultra-comforting roasted parsnip soup 🍜💛

Because I’m obsessed with all things both salty and sweet, I caramelized some leeks and pureed them into the soup with the roasted parsnips, and sprinkled some on top as well for texture.

Leeks have much less moisture than onions, so they caramelize much quicker in the pan. But be careful! That also means it’s easier to burn them if you’re not paying attention since they dry out faster. 🔥

And for a slight bit of crunch and a wonderfully toasted flavor, there’s some roasted hazelnuts sprinkled on top. The tired cook might say “meh, I don’t really need those” and cut them from the grocery list, but let me insist, that you *do* in fact need them. They are SUCH a good complement to the roasted parsnip soup, and if you get tired of the same texture easily like I do, they add a really nice crunch to an otherwise super smooth soup. And they’re super easy to make (less than 10 minutes to toast them, I promise!) Live a little and go for it, I say! 🙌

You can find the recipe at AdventuresInCooking.com 😋Wishing you the most fantastic week ahead, my friends! 💛💛💛

The color in the dish comes from my power-spice-combo of curry powder and paprika, which are two of my all-time favorite spices. They go SO well with the comforting flavor of chicken & the chunky sweet carrots, and they also compliment the rich and slightly tangy flavor of Greek yogurt, which is used to add some creaminess and even more flavor to the sauce 🤌

You can find the recipe at AdventuresInCooking.com or comment CARROT and I’ll message you a link! 🍲

I always prefer to use either soaked and pureed cashews or Greek yogurt to add creaminess to sauces, the fermentation process of creating yogurt neutralizes a lot of the compounds in dairy that can cause stomach irritability (at least in my case!) so I can still enjoy the flavor and texture without the tummy ache.

Plus there’s loads of fresh herbs and other flavorful veggies like onions, garlic, and green onions, too! Can’t wait for you to enjoy it, my friend!! 😋🧡

I didn’t realize this until I actually made a rotisserie chicken myself, but roasting on the rotisserie cooks it in almost half the time! It was SO fast!! And *dang* was it juicy. Perfectly crisp skin on the outside, and wonderfully tender on the inside. 🤌

I can’t wait to play more with the rotisserie function on this range, and am very tempted to put an entire butternut squash on it just to see what happens.

We had severe storms here in Portland this past week. They were forecast to be a couple days...and then turned into a week-long barrage of ice and winds and subzero temperatures. We lost power for a day, which is nothing compared to other folks in our city who had no power for 5+ days.

I’m grateful that the storm has passed, and the worst thing that happened in our household was mild frostbite on one of our chicken’s combs. She got it on the first night of the storm so we’ve kept her inside since then and it’s healing up nicely. (It’s Bebe, which is the same chicken who survived a raccoon attack this past summer. It’s been one helluva year for this poor weathered ol’ gal). 🐔♥️
