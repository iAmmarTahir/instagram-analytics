13327873,gkstories,CaSekXlNeXY,False,"Big announcement! We're so excited to finally share the cover of our new book Green Kitchen: Quick + Slow.
‚Ä¶
This book captures the two different cooking situations we often find ourselves in throughout a week.
We‚Äôve got recipes for the little moments ‚Äì The QUICK. The easy before-work-breakfasts, the simple but special lunch you make for yourself (Lunch-Therapy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è), the weekday dinner when you don‚Äôt want to spend the whole day in the kitchen but still want to eat something delicious. An easy soba and tofu salad, a blitz-roasted tomato and harissa pasta served over yogurt, or a speedy lentil and feta bake. Quick, hands-off, low effort ‚Äì big flavor!
But we also cover the special moments ‚Äì The SLOW. When cooking becomes the best part of the day. When you put on your favorite music and focus on making homemade kimchi burgers, mandolin fennel thinly for a crunchy slaw, cook a 4 hour vegetable ragu, pick up that special cheese, or place potatoes in salt brine on Sunday because you want to serve fermented fries the next week. Food you cook when you have friends coming over or when you just want an excuse to have a joyful moment. 
We hope it can be a reminder to balance the quick and slow in the kitchen. And in life. A cookbook, but also a conversation about how food can be our best therapy, friend and the ultimate joy.
‚Ä¶
The book will be out in June and is available to PREORDER via the link in my bio now!!
It‚Äôs always nerve wrecking to write a book and we so hope that you are going to like it. If you want to preorder and spread the message, Luise and I would be immensely grateful.
I can't wait to share more with you, sneak peeks coming soon!...

3 tbsp buckwheat flour
1 tsp baking powder
200 g frozen raspberries
5 tbsp butter
5 tbsp honey
1 cup mixed seeds and nuts

Whisk the eggs in a mixing bowl. Add the milk, grated carrot and spices and whisk until combined. 
Add the oats, almond flour, buckwheat flour and baking powder and stir. Let sit for 10 minutes while setting the oven to 180C / 360F and lining a 20 cm / 8 inch baking tin with baking paper.
Add 1/3 of the raspberries to the bottom of the pan and stir in 1/3 of them into the oat batter.
Melt butter and honey and pour half of it into the oat batter. Pour the oats into the cake tin.
Add the nuts and seeds to the remaining melted honey butter and stir around until everything is coated. Spread the nuts and seeds on top of the oats and finish with the remaining raspberries. Bake in the oven for approx 35 minutes.
