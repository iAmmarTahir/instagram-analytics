288692417,gerdludwig,C34_Dd5BGYB,False,"Viktoriia M. (not her real name), a member of the National Guard at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant, is overcome with emotion as she recounts the harrowing story of her husband. Also a member of the Ukrainian National Guard, he was detained by Russian troops during their occupation of Chornobyl two years ago.

She is heartbroken because she has not yet received any sign that he is alive. Without knowing his whereabouts or the conditions he may be enduring, he is still one of the ""10,000 [prisoners of war] believed to remain in Russian custody."" - Forbes, 10/21/23. I am personally devastated by the diminishing support for Ukraine by the US and other western countries.

In November of last year, I photographed Viktoriia in an unmarked room to protect her and her husband's identities. She remains cautious and fearful for his fate.

I have been documenting the aftermath of the Chornobyl catastrophe for many decades. Since the Russian occupation after the start of the war in Ukraine, I have felt that my work remains unfinished. Following 10 months of negotiations, I was finally granted permission to re-enter the exclusion zone last October. Pay attention to this page over the coming weeks as I will be posting more images and stories from this trip.

288692417,gerdludwig,C2bRE2Wvavj,False,"Joseph Beuys, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, talking about his art in the kitchen of his residence/studio at Drakeplatz in Düsseldorf. This photograph will be included in my upcoming book BEUYS LAND, published by Edition Lammerhuber, available late April of 2024. 

BEUYS LAND is the first book to centralize the natural landscape of the Lower Rhine and Joseph Beuys' purported birthplace, Kleve, within the artist's universe. In January 1978, I captured how Beuys revisited his past in Kleve and its Lower Rhine environs, the place where his journey began. My collection of photographs predominantly features Beuys amidst the characteristic landscape of dykes, ponds, poplar-lined avenues, and the local populace. These images palpably convey the interdependence of Beuys' art concept and the starkness of his landscape. The book also includes never-before-published photographs of Beuys and his wife Eva at their residence/studio in Düsseldorf and the Basler Fasnacht (Carnival of Basel) in Switzerland.

Accompanying my photographs, cultural scientist Frank Mehring explores how Beuys derived inspiration and energy from the Lower Rhine's roots, honed his ecological consciousness, and nurtured the artistic dynamism that propelled him to the forefront of the global art scene.

Today, January 23, 2024 marks the 38th anniversary of Joseph Beuys’ passing.

This photograph was taken inside the highly contaminated reactor #4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (Ukraine, 2011). After the explosion, cleanup crews initially had to pass over hazardous ladders to a section underneath the melted core with life-threatening contamination. To facilitate faster access, a daunting hallway called the leaning staircase was erected. When I entered this area of the reactor, radiation was still so high that access was limited to less than 30 minutes per day.

I have been given the rare opportunity to return to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and reactor #4 itself to document the highly contaminated areas beneath the New Safe Confinement and meet with victims, liquidators, and the few remaining returnees who are still living in the Zone.
