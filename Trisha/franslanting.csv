461426973,franslanting,C3WSaO8vVhj,False,"Photo by @FransLanting On February 15, we celebrate the 150th birthday of the great Antarctic explorer, Sir Ernest Shackleton. He died on remote South Georgia Island and that is where I photographed his grave where sailors visit to pay their respect to the man known as “The Boss.” Shackleton’s Endurance expedition is one of the great exploration epics of all time and it continues to inspire people, including me. The Boss will be commemorated on February 15 with a special ceremony in Westminster Abbey and the announcement of a new Endurance mission. Follow us @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more stories from Antarctica.

461426973,franslanting,C3T5CMDOw5C,False,"Photo by @FransLanting World Bonobo Day overlaps with Valentine’s Day on February 14. It’s a great day to express your love for the ones dearest to you. But I hope you will also recognize our closest relatives on the great tree of life. You’re looking at a female bonobo playing with an infant by balancing it on her feet—a game any human parent can relate to. Bonobos engage in social interactions that we have long associated as exclusively human: They play, and express empathy. Compared with chimps, bonobo brains appear to be more developed in areas vital to emotions, such as feeling empathy and sensing distress in others. 

I made this image at @Lolayabonobo, a remarkable sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where individual animals confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade are given a new lease on life. Perhaps fewer than 15,000 bonobos live in the jungles of the Congo Basin, the only place where they occur in the wild. Their survival depends on our ability to apply the same kind of compassion for them that we cherish so much in ourselves. Let’s spread the love on Valentine’s Day to our next of kin and to the organizations that take care of bonobos like the ones mentioned below. Follow me @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more stories from the world of nature.

461426973,franslanting,C2_LxMtpNhK,False,"Photos by @FransLanting Today is Western Monarch Day. One of the most important overwintering sites for Western Monarch butterflies is just a few minutes from our Studio in Santa Cruz, California, along the coast. The butterflies there survived the extreme storm event we experienced yesterday, but whether they can weather the bigger issues they are confronted with remains a question.

The first image in this post was made this winter. It shows a small cluster of Monarchs in the same place where I made the second image in 1986. You can see the dramatic decline in the overwintering populations. The Western Monarch population has decreased more than 98% from the 1980s due to pesticide use in their summer areas, habitat loss, climate change, and other threats. Yet insects can bounce back quickly when conditions improve and people can help make that happen.

FYI, Western Monarchs spend their summers farther inland and go all the way to the Rocky Mountains. The Eastern Monarch population is much larger and overwinters in Mexico. The @NatGeo story about Monarchs published January 2024 photographed by my friend and colleague, @JaimeRojo, gives a great overview of what Monarchs are faced with. Check the organizations named below to learn more about how you can support Monarchs. And follow us @FransLanting and @ChristineEckstrom for more stories from the frontlines of our changing planet.

Sometimes this triggers a raucous response from other birds nearby. I was impressed by this male who had found a rocky perch that elevated him above his neighbors. Not sure if he succeeded in attracting any females, but he certainly looked like a performer. 

Things are different for visitors to Antarctica this year because of an outbreak of bird flu which has potentially disastrous consequences for penguins, other birds, and marine mammals. Visitor rules have been tightened up to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease. Check my stories to see how I adapted my gear to operate within the new guidelines.

3226279,nature_org,Cxgn-8Yu-bq,False,"We’re happy to share that the incredible Frans Lanting will be on the @nature_org 2023 Global Photo Contest judging panel. Hailed as one of the great nature photographers of our time, Lanting’s influential work appears in numerous publications and exhibitions around the world. For more than three decades he has documented wildlife from the Amazon to Antarctica to promote understanding about the Earth and its natural history through images that convey a passion for nature and a sense of wonder and concern about our living planet.

Lanting has received honors and acclaim for his work. H.R.H. Prince Bernhard inducted him as a Knight in the Royal Order of the Golden Ark, the Netherlands’ highest conservation honor. He has received top honors from World Press Photo, the title of BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year, and the Sierra Club’s Ansel Adams Award. He has been inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in London and is a recipient of Sweden’s Lennart Nilsson Award. Lanting acts as an Ambassador for the World Wildlife Fund Netherlands and sits on the National Council of the World Wildlife Fund USA, as well as on the Leadership Council of Conservation International, and on the International Board of WildAid. He is also a Trustee of the Foundation Board of the University of California Santa Cruz. He is a co-founder of the North American Nature Photographers Association and a Fellow of the International League of Conservation Photographers

Lanting’s mission is to use photography to help create leverage for conservation efforts ranging from local initiatives to global campaigns, through his publications, alliances, public appearances, and active support of environmental organizations. Along with his wife and partner Christine Eckstrom, Lanting recently launched Bay of Life: From Wind to Whales. This project explores and educates on the importance of California’s Monterey Bay ecosystem, which The Nature Conservancy identified as the “hottest hot spot for biodiversity in North America.”

Morad is a cheetah conservationist with whom I had the pleasure to work while I documented Asia’s last cheetahs, which survive only in Iran. Morad, along with his colleagues from the Persian Wildlife Heritage Foundation, had been wrongly accused of using their camera traps to spy on military activities in Iran. 

We are grateful for Morad’s release, and thank everyone who played a role in this. But we also want to draw attention to the plight of his colleagues who remain in jail.
