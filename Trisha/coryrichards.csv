19028900,coryrichards,C3YGdAtxCJt,False,"Big love to this guy, my dear dear friend Reinaldo Marcus Green for his new film One Love @onelovemovie out in theaters now. I don’t know how many times I’ve talked about the importance of lighting throughout my career. Too many. Which is it’s so funny that Rei and I met in Lamps Plus on some random Tuesday (that’s Rei’s review on the last slide)

Biopics are notoriously hard films to make, especially when the person depicted is still fresh in our memory. Covering an entire life and weaving it all together is an incredibly difficult task. It’s arguable that Bob Marley is the most globally recognizable musician in the world. His music is pervasive and I’ve heard it everywhere I’ve traveled, from an international science station in Antarctica to a boat in the Russian Arctic to a tea house in Tibet. Few contemporary artists have such a fingerprint and I believe his message is important now more than ever.

It’s hard to comprehend the undertaking of Rei, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Lashana Lynch @lashanalynch and everyone else involved in the film. Regardless, under his direction, the roles are transformative and played with incredible skill and care. Well done! Go have some popcorn and let the music you already know be born again.",10,731,1708018219,,https://instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/426532631_18417743176020901_8777387950179431137_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08&_nc_ht=instagram.flba2-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_ohc=xomrTT2esHkAX-_1i7E&edm=AOQ1c0wAAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfBtwZEUODQjayKNrq5FOmnFMBQrba6kiimCM1uPlvd1vw&oe=65E7FD2D&_nc_sid=8b3546,True

The mechanic opens the rear tire, and leaves the parts strewn across the shoulder of the highway. A metal-handled hammer and broken screwdriver finish the job: a blown bearing. The mechanic isn’t much of a talker. He saddles a scooter and buzzes off to somewhere while the town gathers around us, sharing stories and children and a, most proudly, new iPhone 12 ProMax.

Six days ago, Cory did what any responsible motorcyclist would do: he watched a YouTube video titled “How to Ride a Motorcycle in ONLY 1 HOUR,” which, it turns out, was only twenty minutes long. 
 
Cory then traced the backstreets of Santa Monica on a tiny café racer for five days before boarding a plane for Kathmandu. Now, eight hours of riding on Nepal’s worst and busiest highway later, the sun collapses across rice paddies heavy with grain. We still have hours to go.
